In her first sitting for a magazine, the duchess is seen looking relaxed and wearing casual clothes.
The shoot was in collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery, where two images are being displayed in the Vogue 100: A Century of Style exhibition.
The duchess, who has a keen interest in photography, has been patron of the National Portrait Gallery since 2012.
Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said: ""Josh has captured the duchess exactly as she is - full of life, with a great sense of humour, thoughtful and intelligent, and in fact, very beautiful.""
He said the images also encapsulated what Vogue had done over the past 100 years - ""to pair the best photographers with the great personalities of the day, in order to reflect broader shifts in culture and society"".
Alexandra Shulman, editor-in-chief of British Vogue, said: ""To be able to publish a photographic shoot with the Duchess of Cambridge has been one of my greatest ambitions for the magazine.""
The collaboration for the June edition had resulted in ""a true celebration of our centenary as well as a fitting tribute to a young woman whose interest in both photography and the countryside is well known"", she said.
Other royal portraits to have featured in the fashion magazine include Diana, Princess of Wales - who graced the cover four times - and Princess Anne.

It has gone on to be closely associated with offensive and often illegal activity, including instances where the images of child abuse were shared.
It was widely credited as being the first place where leaked images of nude celebrities were posted following 2014's well-publicised security breach affecting Apple's iCloud service. That incident prompted a policy change on the site.
However, 4chan has also been the rallying point for many instances of online activism from the likes of Anonymous, the loosely organized hacktivism group.
Mr Poole shared news of his new position on blogging site Tumblr.

The signing of Neymar has been correct and his signing has caused despair and envy in some of our adversaries
Rosell, speaking at a news conference after a Barca board meeting, insisted he had ""acted correctly"".
Vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu now takes over from the 49-year-old Rosell, who came to power in 2010.
Rosell's future has been a real source of concern ever since a Spanish national court judge accepted a lawsuit this week from Barcelona club member Jordi Cases, who alleged that the amount paid for Neymar was more than the reported fee.
Rosell maintains the accusation is ""unfair and reckless"".
He added: ""For some time, my family and myself have suffered threats and attacks in silence. These threats and attacks have made me wonder if being president means having to jeopardise my family.
""From the beginning, I have said the signing of Neymar has been correct and his signing has caused despair and envy in some of our adversaries.""
Rosell said he was resigning to spare the club's board of directors from ""unfair attacks"" that could ""negatively affect their management or the image of the club"".
He added: ""It has been an honour to serve the Barcelonistas. It's been a privilege to be the president of FC Barcelona.""
Rosell was named Barca president in the summer of 2010 after winning a landslide vote to succeed Joan Laporta, earning 61.34% of a record turn-out of 57,088 voters.

7,"The think tank said the city's 1,536 schools needed to save £360m in the first year if the government's National Funding Formula (NFF) plan goes ahead.
The amount is the equivalent of 12,857 qualified teachers, on an average salary of £28,000.
The government said London was the highest funded part of the country.
It added that under the plans, which are under consultation, inner-city schools would be allocated 30% more money per pupil than the national average.
But London Councils, which represents the city's 32 boroughs and the City, said no school would gain enough funding from the NFF to compensate for increased cost pressures from inflation, higher pension contributions and national insurance.
Ministers said the new formula was needed to tackle uneven levels of funding across England, with the best funded areas getting more than £6,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded averaging £4,200.
It said the funding cut was on top of National Audit Office figures which showed England schools faced an eight per cent real-terms cut per pupil by 2019-20 because it  wider cost pressures.
In a statement, London Councils said: ""At a time when UK schools are seen as underperforming by international standards, and when businesses based in London are facing massive uncertainty about recruiting skilled staff, there is an urgent need to invest in schools in London and across the rest of the country.""
It added: ""Without the right qualifications and skills, London's children will be unable to access jobs and contribute to the national economy. Over 60% of jobs in inner London require a degree and around 45% of jobs in the rest of the capital require a degree.""

Burns and Roy put on a 118-run fourth wicket stand as Surrey closed on 384-8.
Roy's century was a fine retort against Division One leaders Middlesex, who dismissed the England limited-overs opener for a first-ball duck in the One-Day Cup on Tuesday.

Separately, Ms Cooper warned there was a ""serious risk the party will split"" if the left-winger becomes its leader.
It comes as Labour begins sending out the first ballot papers to voters.
The result of the contest will be announced at a special conference on 12 September.

Meanwhile voting in the election for the new Scottish Labour leader ended at midday.
Mr Corbyn is due to unveil a 10-point policy plan while in Glasgow later.
The popularity of the left-wing Islington North MP, who is promising ""a new kind of politics"", has sparked a row about the future direction of the Labour party.
Another leadership contender, Andy Burnham, told the BBC Mr Corbyn's policies ""lack credibility"".
""It's not possible to promise free university education, re-nationalising the utilities, without that coming at a great cost and if you can't explain how that is going to be paid for then I don't think we'll win back the trust of voters on the economy,"" he said.
BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said there had been ""frustration"" in rival camps who accused Mr Burnham of being reluctant to take on Mr Corbyn. This appeared to be his most direct attack yet, he added.
But in an interview with Jeremy Vine on BBC Radio 2, Mr Burnham declined to follow Ms Kendall and Ms Cooper and advise his supporters not to back Mr Corbyn with their second and third preferences.
He added: ""People will say if they hear things like that, 'hang on, what do you believe?'""
In an interview with The Independent, Ms Kendall called for voters to mark Ms Cooper or Mr Burnham as second and third preferences, and avoid giving votes to Mr Corbyn.
""I have set out very clearly where I differ with all the candidates but our differences with Jeremy's kind of politics are far greater,"" said Ms Kendall.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme she said she ""can't pretend to be agnostic"" about a victory for Mr Corbyn, saying of the voting process: ""It is an alternative vote system and I want to urge party members to use all of their different preferences.
""I will be using my second and third preferences and I would urge others to do the same because I don't want to see our party go back to the politics of the '80s, just being a party of protest.""
The Leicester West MP also said she did not see the party splitting, as it did in the 1980s when Labour members formed the Social Democratic Party.
However, Ms Cooper told BBC 2's Newsnight: ""I think there is a serious risk that the party will split, will polarise and I cannot bear to see that happen because there is too much at stake.""
Asked in an interview with grassroots Labour website Labourlist whether voters should use their votes to try to prevent Mr Corbyn winning, she said: ""I think people should use all of their preferences.
""And I think the focus has to be how do we make sure we can win that election, and that's the most important thing - and I don't think Jeremy can do that.""
Mr Corbyn has warned against ""personal abuse"" in the campaign, saying he wants to focus on policy.
His policy programme includes a commitment to ""growth not austerity"", nationalising the railways and energy sector, and a plan for nuclear disarmament.
In an essay for the Fabian Society he also suggested Labour's new increased following should be more involved in the party and proposed a review of membership fees to make the party more ""inclusive"".
Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is expected to join the debate over the leadership contest with a speech on Sunday, called ""power for a purpose - the future of the Labour Party"".
Lance Price, former director of communications for Labour, told the BBC the contest had been an ""unedifying mess"" and had ""done nothing to reengage the labour party with those millions of people who deserted it"".

10,"The Association of School and College Leaders says England's schools have had to make more than £1bn savings this year, rising to £3bn by 2020.
The government says school funding is at a record £40bn, with rises ahead.
Education Secretary Justine Greening will hear heads' cash grievances at Friday's ASCL conference in Birmingham.
She is due to address the union, which has published a survey of its members on the issue.
It suggests schools are finding it difficult to make savings without cutting provision and that things are predicted to get worse over the next two years.
Cost pressures are rising as greater pay, pension and national insurance costs are having to be covered from school budgets.
ASCL complains a new funding formula for schools has reduced the basic level of school funding going forwards by too much.
The meeting comes two days after requests for more money to spend on daily school costs were ignored by the chancellor in the Budget.
Philip Hammond however did pledge £500m for school buildings, mainly new free schools - some of which could be grammar schools.
One respondent said his school was moving to a ""bare bones education"", in which ""the components that make education special and enjoyable are being eroded away"".
Some 95% of the 1,054 heads, deputies and senior teachers responding to the survey said they had cut back on support services - including equipment and materials, as well as mental health and special needs support.
More than eight out of 10 said class sizes had increased - a claim strongly refuted by the Department for Education.
And more than two-thirds said they had cut back on activities like clubs and trips.
Just under three-quarters of respondents with GCSE-level classes said they had cut courses and just over three-quarters of heads with A-level students said they had also reduced subjects.
Foreign modern languages, music, arts and drama were among subjects removed at A-level.
Another said: ""Through no fault of their own, students will have restricted subject choices, in larger class sizes with less pastoral support, whilst still being expected to perform at the highest of standards - nonsense!""
One head said his school may have to axe its sixth form provision for next year and another said his school was starting to ""creak"" with all staff working to full capacity.
Interim general secretary, Malcolm Trobe, said: ""School leaders will do their utmost to protect provision, as they always do, but they cannot provide everything that is asked of them without the resources they need.
""Unless the government invests more in the education system, there will be a significant impact on the lives and life chances of young people.""
A spokesman for the DfE said: ""As this week's Budget demonstrates, the government is determined to ensure every child has access to a good school place and is given the opportunity to fulfil their potential.
""The government has protected the core schools budget in real terms since 2010, with school funding at its highest level on record at more than £40bn in 2016-17 - and that is set to rise, as pupil numbers rise over the next two years, to £42bn by 2019-20.""

But she said she judged her time as PCC as a success.
She said Kent Police was now target-free, provided quality service and put victims at the heart of its work.
""Apart from one or two things I'd rather not have happened, I've really, really had a good time,"" she said.
Referring to incidents that led to adverse headlines, she said: ""You have to accept what life throws at you and deal with it.""
Mrs Barnes, who is not standing for re-election, said the Kent force was recognised nationally after latest HMIC reports.
""[Kent Police] genuinely puts victims at the heart of what it does. There are no targets, people don't chase targets. They just look to do a quality service,"" she said.
On her youth commissioner appointments, Mrs Barnes said: ""You can't interview for the unexpected.""
Kent's first youth commissioner Paris Brown resigned over comments she had posted on Twitter, and Kerry Boyd had to stop public engagements while reports of a relationship were investigated.
Mrs Barnes said Ms Brown handled things well after making mistakes when younger, and Ms Boyd did a good job and could have continued but turned down an extended contract.
After Ms Boyd left, the youth commissioner was not replaced.
Mrs Barnes said she was most proud of Kent Police's ""open and transparent"" culture.

On Saturday Newport host fourth-placed Northampton Town hoping to win their third game in a row for the first time since last December, 2014.

It also said it was the subject of a two-page article in the winter edition of the council magazine which was distributed to all households in the region.

17,"More than a dozen men stormed into the Kiwi cafe in the Georgian capital on Sunday evening, the cafe said, shouting and throwing meat at patrons.
A brawl erupted but the attackers fled before police arrived.
Police are now investigating, and say they have questioned the attackers and cafe staff. Nobody has been arrested.
The cafe has appealed for public support, saying it was no prank but a case of intimidation by neo-Nazis.
The attackers wore strings of sausages round their necks and threw chunks of meat onto customers' plates, the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie reports from Tbilisi.
They are known as the Bergmann group, and a social media page shows their attacks on people of Arab or African origin, our correspondent reports. One photograph shows members making the Nazi salute.
The Kiwi cafe is in a traditional part of old Tbilisi, and is popular among young people sporting unconventional hairstyles, tattoos and body piercings.
Most Georgians are Orthodox Christians and many see unorthodox lifestyles as a corrupting influence from the West.
The cafe said it had drawn some local hostility because of ""the way we look, music that we listen to, ideas we support, and the fact that we don't eat meat"" and backing of causes such as rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.
""During these hard times you can support us just by visiting our cafe, we will be very grateful if you come to show everyone that here are a lot of us who care about the issue!"" the Kiwi cafe said in a statement on Facebook.
It later told the BBC it had received strong messages of solidarity - from Georgia and abroad - but that people had also left angry comments trying ""to defend those fascists"".
It said it was also appealing for financial contributions to install security cameras in case of repeat incidents.
The incident comes amid growing concerns about the rise of far-right nationalism in Georgia.
Last week, hundreds of nationalists marched through central Tbilisi - waving Georgian flags and anti-communist banners, reports said - to mark independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
Homophobia is also commonplace in Georgia, correspondents say. The country made world headlines in 2013 when a small group of LGBT activists were attacked by a large mob led by an orthodox priest.
The cafe statement blames Sunday's incident on the group of men who came into the premises, talking loudly, throwing meat and smoking, and then ""yelling, laughing, and talking to us sarcastically"".
These people ""were neo-Nazis... who support fascist ideas"", the cafe said.
Some minor injuries were sustained.
The police arrived only after the attackers had left, but the cafe said even some of those officers behaved aggressively, ""yelled with anger, said that we are guilty of what had happened"".

Bradshaw, who has scored three goals in 19 appearances for the Tykes this season, puts the success of the pair down to two factors.
""You watch them train and you watch them play and you try to pick their brains about how they managed to get to that level,"" he said.
""A lot of it is natural ability and natural talent, but the thing that strikes me is their hunger; their hunger to want to improve even though Gareth's playing for Real Madrid and he's a massive part of his country's team.""
Bradshaw says he was ""gutted"" to miss out on Wales' memorable Euro 2016 campaign after a calf injury ruled him out of contention.
The former Aberystwyth Town player has since concentrated on boosting his future Wales hopes by performing well for his new club Barnsley.
""It was incredibly frustrating, with hindsight as well, at how well the lads did,"" he said.

21,"John MacIntosh, 46, of Dingwall, must serve at least 10 years in prison after being convicted by a jury of four serious sexual offences.
At the High Court in Aberdeen, judge Lord Uist said MacIntosh was a ""sexual fiend"" who targeted vulnerable females.
MacIntosh had previously been jailed for seven years for having sex with 13 and 14-year-old girls.
The offences heard at the High Court in Aberdeen happened in the Inverness and Dingwall areas between 1996 and 2004.
He sexually assaulted and attempted to rape the young girl and raped three women.
In his sentencing statement, Lord Uist said: ""You targeted vulnerable females in order to gratify your carnal lust.
""You have called all these women liars and shown no remorse for what you did.""
The judge added: ""It is clear to me that you have no respect for women and are a sexual fiend.""
Lord Uist said MacIntosh should not assume that he would be automatically released after having served 10 years in prison.
He said: ""You will be released only when the Parole Board for Scotland is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that you continue to be held in prison.""
Police Scotland has welcomed the life sentence.
Det Insp Eddie Ross said the case was brought to the attention of police by the NHS.
He said: ""During the investigation there was also significant involvement from the local authority in terms of housing and social work support for not only the victims but also their children.
""However, the most important people in all this are the victims and I must pay tribute to them in both coming forward to the police and staying with the prosecution process to conviction.
""I hope that this result will bring some comfort to the victims in this case and give confidence to anyone who has suffered similar experiences to come forward in the knowledge that their case will be sensitively and thoroughly investigated.""

22,"A spokesman for the governor in Nangahar province said an Afghan commando had opened fire on the US troops during a joint operation in Achin. He was shot dead in return fire.
Another US soldier was reportedly wounded in the attack.
A spokesman for the Taliban said it had carried out the attack.
Islamic State militants also operate in the area.
Earlier, at least two Afghan policemen were killed by US forces in a so-called friendly fire incident in southern Afghanistan.
The deaths are said to have occurred when a US aircraft returned fire during a joint operation in the restive province of Helmand.
It is reported to be the first friendly fire incident in Helmand since US Marines returned there in May.
Taliban insurgents have made widespread gains in the province.
In a statement, the US military apologised for the incident and said that an investigation had been launched.
It happened as police were on patrol in volatile Nad Ali district. The dead were members of the Afghan Border Police.
Afghan officials told AFP news agency that the policemen were patrolling too close to a Taliban base prior to the attack. They say a number of militants were also killed in the strike.
In recent months, the Taliban have captured several districts in Helmand and put provincial capital Lashkar Gah under pressure.
The arrival of hundreds of US Marines - following the withdrawal of US troops three years ago - is part of the Nato-led effort to train and assist Afghan forces. They include special forces who conduct separate counter-terrorism operations.
Air strikes by US warplanes have risen significantly over the last few months as President Donald Trump and other foreign leaders come under pressure to commit more troops.
Afghanistan has been hit by numerous violent attacks in recent weeks with the launch of the Taliban's spring offensive, including a massive bomb attack in the capital, Kabul, that killed more than 150 people.

24,"Cathay is one of the world's biggest cargo airlines, and its decision is expected to have a sizeable impact.
Previously, the airline had said it would only transport shark fin that was sustainably sourced.
Shark fin is considered a delicacy in Chinese cuisine and is often served as a soup at upmarket banquets.
More than 70 million sharks are killed every year, according to WWF figures. Large numbers are exported to Hong Kong, where they are consumed or further exported to mainland China.
""On the issue of shark's fin, with immediate effect we are happy to agree to ban the carriage,"" Cathay Pacific said in a statement on Wednesday.
It said it had not approved any shark fin shipments over the last year, pointing out that it had turned down 15 shipment requests for shark-related products.
Early reports said the ban extended to all shark products on cargo and passenger flights, but the airline told the BBC it currently applied to shark fin only,
Cathay said it would continue to review its policy.
Marine conservationists hailed Cathay's decision, with one proclaiming that it would make Hong Kong ""proud"".
""More Hong Kong businesses need to follow the lead,"" Hong Kong-based conservationist Sharon Kwok told AFP.
Government data cited by the South China Morning Post shows that shark fin imports to Hong Kong dropped by 42% between 2010 and 2015 to 5,717 tonnes.
During this period there was also a significant decline in imports by air.
Cathay now joins airlines including British Airways, American Airlines, Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Emirates in banning shark fin.

26,"The 5,500-year-old Neolithic axe was found during archaeological surveys ahead of a multi-billion euro tunnel project.
The axe seems to have been jammed into what was once the seabed, perhaps as part of a ritual offering.
The lack of oxygen in the clay ground helped preserve the wooden handle.
The find was made in Rodbyhavn on the Danish island of Lolland, which is to be connected to the German island of Fehmarn via the tunnel link.
""Finding a hafted [handle-bearing] axe as well preserved as this one is quite amazing,"" said Soren Anker Sorensen, an archaeologist at the Museum Lolland-Falster in Denmark.
Archaeologists have found other similarly well preserved organic material in the area during their excavations.
These include upright wooden stakes, a paddle, bows and other axe shafts.
Axes were vital tools for Stone Age people, who used them for working wood. However, they also played an important role during the introduction of farming to Europe, when the majority of the land was covered by dense forests.
The archaeologists suggest that the Neolithic communities of south Lolland may have been using the coast as an offering area.
Earlier this month, archaeologists working on the Fehmarn Belt Tunnel scheme announced that they had uncovered 5,000-year-old footprints along the edge of an ancient fish trap excavated at Rodbyhavn.

27,"Trouble is, the aspen tree itself doesn't like to produce seeds which makes life very difficult for everyone.
But last year I visited Shropshire company Forestart and helped them out with their plans to get their aspens in a seed producing mood.
Forestart harvests a billion wild tree seeds every year to grow into new trees for planting.
You can read a blogpost about their plans here, but here's the general gist.
Aspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree.
That's no good for Forestart who need seeds to grow new aspens.
The last time aspens in Scotland flowered and produced seeds was twenty years ago.
So Robert Lee from Forestart had a plan. I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees.
Not all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk.
The idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds.
Well this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature.
Robert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see.
It's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year.
Can we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference?
Well yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree.
Those branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden.
It's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers.
The trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future.
Meaning more chances for people who want to plant this most wonderful of our native trees.
The only slight cloud on the horizon is if the whole effort is too successful, we get a lot of seeds and the local bird population treat the aspen seeds as a very expensive lunch.
Fingers crossed the siskins find something else to eat instead! A summary is",Aspens are one of our most beautiful native trees and there's a huge demand for seeds to grow new ones for planting.,None,generation
28,"The hyperbaric chamber, which treats divers with ""the bends"", was operated by St John's Ambulance on a donation basis until it broke in April 2014.
The health department replaced it in 2015, but says it needs to ""balance the books"".
Diving instructor Steve Bougourd said he was ""gobsmacked"".
""I'm just worried that this kind of cost will put people off of actually going to the [hospital] and notifying them if they suspect a problem,"" he said.
""We may find it's going to be very expensive to get out divers insured.""
In the UK hyperbaric oxygen treatment is covered by the NHS, but Guernsey has its own health care system.
Source: NHS
Assistant director at Guernsey's health and social care department (HSC) Ed Freestone said renting the chamber was costing the government £60,000 a year.
He said the department would not make a profit from the new charges, which were based on ""the average usage that we could identify over the previous few years"".
In addition to paying for the training of staff and the maintenance of a 24 hour service, the department had to fund plans to buy its own chamber for about £250,000, Mr Freestone said.
Commercial divers already pay a £150 notification fee to dive which raises about £10,000 a year, according to HSC.
It is a legal requirement to provide a hyperbaric chamber facility for commercial diving activity to take place within Guernsey's 12-mile limit.

Jews in the city of Ahmedabad, where the shop opened last month, said using the Nazi dictator's name was offensive. Israeli diplomats also raised the issue with the Gujarat state government.
The owners said they did not know who Adolf Hitler was when the shop opened.
Mr Shah told the BBC: ""Yes we are planning to change the name. There has been too much political pressure from the government.""
He said officials had promised compensation for the rebranding of the store, which sells men's clothing, although he said they had provided nothing in writing.
His co-owner, Manish Chandani, told AFP news agency they had never intended to glorify Hitler.
""I was not aware of Hitler being responsible for the killings of six million people before the shop's inauguration. This time I will choose a non-controversial name.""
Mr Chandani says the shop's name was a tribute to his grandfather who was nicknamed Hitler because he was ""very strict"".
Others saw the name as a marketing gimmick in a country where the former German leader attracts unusual interest in some sections of society.
""I am happy that the store owner decided to change the name. I guess he realised that it was not the right thing to do,"" Orna Sagiv, Israeli consul general in Mumbai, told AFP.

31,"IS ""fired at everything that moved"" after entering on Thursday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says.
Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled.
IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa.
Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS ""caliphate"", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria.
""According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,"" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory.
He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey.
He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer.
The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes.
The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings.
Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms.
In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children.
Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town.
Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added.
Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months.
Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others have been forced from their homes.

37,"The US Commerce Department said the economy grew at an annualised pace of 1.4% in the January-to-March period.
The rate was an upward revision from the previous estimate of 1.2%, which itself was an increase from the original reading of 0.7%.
However, it still marks a slowdown from the final quarter of 2016, when the economy grew at a rate of 2.1%.
The latest growth figure was helped by an increased estimate for growth in consumer spending, which was revised up to a rate of 1.1% from 0.6%.
""The economy is expanding at a solid, if unspectacular pace,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services.
Growth estimates in the first quarter are often weak, a quirk some say is due to the difficulty of measuring the effect of seasonal changes.
Thursday's update bolsters the perspective of the Federal Reserve, which increased interest rates in June.
Policymakers at the time said they did not believe the slowdown in the first quarter was the start of a trend, pointing to one-off factors, including a relatively mild winter.
Stronger-than-expected trade figures published Wednesday also led some to predict better growth in the second quarter.
Even so, many say growth for the year is all but certain to fall short of the 3% goal outlined by US President Donald Trump. Mr Faucher forecasts growth around 2.2% for the year.

39,"Class-A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine were among the illegal substances seized, according to the data from police in England and Wales.
There were more than 2,000 incidents dating back to 2011, suggest figures from 34 police forces.
Teachers described the statistics as a ""worry"" and the ""tip of the iceberg"".
The figures were obtained by the Press Association news agency (PA) under the Freedom of Information Act.
PA sent Freedom of Information requests to every police force in England and Wales asking how many times illegal drugs had been seized or confiscated from school premises in the period from March 2011 to the end of 2014.
The query asked for details of the type and amount of drug involved, its value, the type of school (primary or secondary) and details of who it was seized or confiscated from.
Just over three-quarters of forces replied.
Of these, 28 forces gave details of the types of drugs involved, 18 forces identified the type of school and 13 the ages of the individuals involved.
The data reveals cannabis was involved in 625 of the cases and cocaine in 27.
Other drugs confiscated included LSD, amphetamines and ecstasy.
Overall there were two cases each of heroin possession at schools in the West Midlands, Surrey and Greater Manchester, plus another in Hertfordshire.
Only four incidents involved children under 11.
An eight-year-old and a nine-year-old in Staffordshire were caught with cannabis, as was a 10-year-old girl at a Leicester primary school, while another 10-year-old in Greater Manchester was carrying £5 worth of the drug.
There were 241 incidents involving 15- to 16-year-olds and 231 incidents involving 11- to 14-year-olds.
In Greater Manchester, a 14-year-old was caught with heroin with a street value of £500, and a 16-year-old with a quantity worth £330.
Other incidents involved parents or school employees, including a school gardener in Humberside and a cleaner at a Manchester primary.
The highest number of incidents and offences in the three complete years to March 2014 was for Hampshire with 229 cases.
There were 144 incidents in Avon and Somerset and 138 in the West Midlands.
South Wales police reported 92 cases.

41,"Eighteen men, aged between 19 and 29 and some in prison, are banned from parts of Birmingham and must register phones and vehicles with police.
The two-year orders aim to disrupt gang-related violence between the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew.
West Midlands Police said it was ""a landmark ruling"".
The orders follow a spate of firearms offences in the city in 2015 and 2016, but the gangs have struck fear across parts of Birmingham for many years.
They gained notoriety in 2003 when their violent feud claimed the lives of two girls - Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis - outside a late-night new year party in the city. Four men were later jailed for life for their murders.
The gangs have also been behind countless drive-by shootings, drug dealing, intimidation, robberies and kidnappings.
After more recent incidents of gun crime in the city, West Midlands Police and the council sought to secure the injunctions in a civil case heard at Birmingham Crown Court earlier this year.
The force secured interim injunctions in 2016 and said at the time it did not want to identify anyone until they were permanent.  The BBC revealed their names after obtaining the county court documents.
More than 80 people from the Home Office and police gave evidence between February and June ahead of the orders being granted in July, which the force has revealed for the first time now.
Two have already been issued, three men are being sought by police and three properties were visited by officers on Wednesday.
The men are forbidden from associating with each other and entering the city centre, Handsworth, Newtown, Winson Green and Lozells.
In a copy of an injunction seen by the BBC, gang members are also banned from appearing in music videos that include material linked to the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew. One such music video was shown during the court proceedings.
Ten other men will receive the orders in jail where restrictions will be imposed on certain visitors to limit any gang associations, police said.
Among those to be given the injunctions in prison are two men believed to have been the ""armed response"" faction of the Burger Bar Boys.
Reial Phillips, 21, from Winson Green was jailed for 27 years last year after seven people were injured in a series of shootings during a feud with members of the Johnson Crew.
His co-defendant 23-year-old Ashai Gray, from Walsall, was jailed for nine years after admitting conspiracy to supply cocaine and heroin.
Police said their actions ""brought fear"" to people in the West Midlands.
Gang injunctions came into force in England and Wales in 2011. Home Office figures show that between January 2011 and January 2014, 88 had been put in place.
The first one issued in the West Midlands was in 2012.
But solicitor Errol Robinson, who represented two of the four men jailed for the new year murders, criticised the move.
""They don't change behaviour or address underlying issues,"" he said.
""Injunctions become a bit of a trophy and encourage rebellion. Gang members like to show that they're not listening to orders so will breach orders.
""It's a cheap way of trying to solve crime but there is no evidence to suggest that they work.
""They're just a cosmetic gesture to show people that something is being done about gangs - but actually the results are minimum to none.""
From former gang members the BBC has spoken to, there is little support for the mechanism, BBC Midlands Correspondent Sima Kotecha said.
She said a number of gang members had said that if a person is banned from going to a certain part of a city, they will just go somewhere else and find others who have the same goal of causing violence and disruption.
Birmingham has seen another spike in gun and knife crime in 2017, with nine fatal stabbings this year. None of the men named in the injunctions are involved, police said.
Det Sgt Ian Comfort said: ""This is relatively new legislation and we believe that securing final full injunctions on such a large number of gang members is a UK first.
""The injunctions are applied for in the civil court in addition to sentences handed out by the criminal court for offences. They are an additional measure to help control the offenders and keep the community safe.""
Supt Mat Shaer, neighbourhood policing superintendent for Birmingham, said the injunctions were ""not sought lightly"" and the police, council and other groups had already made ""exhaustive efforts with these men"" and their families to try and steer them away gang culture.
Organised gangs in Birmingham have been a part of the city's life since the 1870s. Some have been mythologised on TV such as the Peaky Blinders.
But today's gangs linked to guns and drugs are far from glamorous and bring terror and misery to many people's lives.
The names Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew sprang on to the crime scene in the late 1990s.
Chaotic and quick to wreak violence, their crimes reached a crescendo one night at a new year's party in 2003 when two innocent teenage girls, Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis, died in a spray of machine gun fire in a drive-by shooting as members of the Burger Bar Boys attempted to kill a Johnson Crew man stood outside a Birmingham party.
That shocking display of gang callousness led to a concerted effort by government, police and the city council, and 10 years later it led some to believe that the gangs had been defeated as gun crime fell dramatically.
But in the last 18 months, a new generation of would-be gang members have arisen and shootings have begun to surge upwards.
Even in the last few weeks, the police have been shot at as they carried out an anti-gun operation in the Ladywood area of the city.

42,"Gary Haggarty, 44, is no longer to be prosecuted for three alleged offences.
His lawyers said these relate to possessing explosives and firearms.
His legal team are also set to challenge the ""propriety"" of prosecuting a man they say worked as a state agent for some of the remaining 209 counts against him.
On Wednesday, Belfast Magistrates' Court was told that a hearing to decide if the suspected UVF commander-turned police informer has a case to answer is scheduled for November.
Mr Haggarty has been waiting to discover if he will stand trial since signing an agreement to become an assisting offender under the terms of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act (SOCPA) back in 2010.
The north Belfast man was charged with 212 charges covering a 16-year period between 1991 and 2007.
The prosecution case against him runs to 12,000 pages, with his alleged offences including:
Mr Haggarty, whose address is listed as c/o the Police Service of Northern Ireland, is believed to be living at a secret location in England.
He was not present for the latest stage in an ongoing court review of the case.
Outside court, Mr Haggarty's solicitor said a challenge would be mounted against some of the remaining charges.
""The defence forwarded written submissions to the PPS on 4 May dealing firstly with charges where we say the papers do not disclose a prima facie case, but also charges where there are issues in relation to the propriety of the charges at a time when the defendant was a state agent from 1993-2004,"" he said.

The Avon and Somerset branch of the federation said it ""cannot envisage"" how the public or police can have ""confidence in his leadership"".
Mr Gargan said he understood people had questions and said he would address these.
In a statement issued through the Chief Police Officers Staff Association, he said he was ""very much looking forward to returning to work"" and ""beginning the process of rebuilding confidence in the force"".
The comments about his return to work were made in an open letter to Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens.
Mr Gargan was suspended following allegations of data protection breaches and inappropriate behaviour with women.
A panel found him guilty of misconduct - but cleared him of gross misconduct. His suspension was lifted and a phased return to work prepared.
Mr Gargan said his actions had ""fallen below the standards expected of a chief constable"".
In the letter seen by the BBC, the Police Federation said the chief constable is ""the person that sets the standard of professional behaviour and ethical conduct"" and the role ""must be beyond reproach"" in the eyes of the public and police officers.
It said its officers had been asked on a daily basis by ""the communities they serve"" how the chief constable ""can return to work in these circumstances"".
The letter ends with the federation calling on the commissioner to ""show strong leadership in dealing with this issue"".
Some former members of the force have also criticised Mr Gargan's return.

He was found hanging in woodland on 21 June.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) said it has already changed its procedures.
An inquest into Mr Jones' death heard he had been a patient at the Hergest unit until a few days before his disappearance and continued to suffer anxiety and paranoia after he left hospital.
He turned up at the unit in the early hours of 3 April and was sent to the accident and emergency department but left without booking in or speaking to anyone.
Robat Hughes, the senior nurse who spoke to Mr Jones at the unit, told the inquest he regretted not asking him whether he was already having treatment.
""He came to the door and asked to see a doctor, but I said there was no doctor there as she'd gone home sick.  I said that if he went to accident and emergency then there were doctors there,"" he said.
""He was relaxed and calm.  I didn't know if he was using mental health services and I didn't ask.

45,"Wholesale prices have dropped and motoring organisations have suggested this merits reduced pump prices.
Tesco and Morrisons are cutting prices by 2p a litre on Friday, and Asda and Sainsbury's said they would reduce prices by up to 2p a litre on Saturday.
But drivers are being warned that prices can vary in different areas.
The average UK price for a litre of unleaded petrol was 118.83p on Thursday, and 120.88p for a litre of diesel, according to the latest figures from Experian Catalist.
Ten days earlier, the average unleaded price was 120p a litre, and diesel cost 122.06p.
The oil price and wholesale prices fell sharply at the start of March, and motoring organisations have argued that this should have been feeding through to another 2p cut per litre in prices at the pumps.
The RAC said motorists could feel ""aggrieved"" that prices had not fallen further, earlier.
Asda said it had dropped prices twice in two weeks, and had a national price cap to ensure motorists were dealt with equitably. Morrisons said it had also made a second cut in two weeks.
Tesco is dropping petrol and diesel prices by 2p a litre over the course of Friday afternoon at all its outlets, followed by Sainsbury's on Saturday.
Luke Bosdet, of the AA, said that there was general concern that so-called supermarket fuel price wars did not actually benefit all drivers across the country.
He claimed prices fell the most in areas where there were a range of supermarkets located close to each other. In other areas with less competition, the same cuts were not as likely to be seen.

However, the council has admitted that there will never be a consensus on any flood protection proposal.
A report to a meeting of Dumfries and Galloway Council's environment committee next week will attempt to find a way forward.
What's happening in Scotland? Keep in touch through our live page.
Chairman Colin Smyth said: ""What we are now able to do is focus on what I think is the biggest issue as far as the public is concerned. In the draft proposal, the height of the embankment and the walls were simply too high and the public did not support that.
""What we now need to do is make sure that we find a solution that deals with the flooding, regenerates the Whitesands, solves the car parking issues, but also reduces the height of any proposed flood protection scheme.""
Water from the River Nith regularly spills over into the Whitesands, flooding a major town centre car park and nearby business premises.
Campaigners against the Â£15m proposal to build an embankment claimed it would have a detrimental effect on the town's main beauty spots.
They also raised concerns that the move would lead to the loss of about 200 waterfront car parking spaces.
David Slater, a local businessman who has been one of the project's most vocal objectors, said: ""However many other consultations they do now, public opinion will not change at this stage.
""It will be interesting to see how they can agree with the public to reduce the height of the bunds. There has to be better ideas because we can't put that in our town.""

Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire is also in the millionaire's club, according to research by Lloyds Bank.
They are the first towns outside London where prices have hit seven figures.
The research was based on data from the Land Registry for the first half of 2015.
Prices in Virginia Water - home to the likes of Sir Cliff Richard and Sir Bruce Forsyth - average no less than £1.169m, making it Britain's most expensive town outside the capital.
No wonder that the town's famous golf course, Wentworth, feels able to charge joining fees of £125,000. That is on top of the annual membership fee of £16,000.
Cobham - familiar to Chelsea footballers and their WAGS - has average prices of £1.043m.
And anyone wanting to buy in Beaconsfield can expect to pay £1.003m.
""We're seeing the emergence of towns where the average price is at least £1 million,"" said Sarah Deaves, private banking director at Lloyds Bank.
""Whilst there are several London neighbourhoods where prices are already at this elevated level, outside of the capital this is a first.""
However the figures also show a sharp slow-down in the number of homes sold for more than £1m.
In the first half of 2015 there were 5,599 such sales, down from 6,303 in 2014. That amounts to an 11% fall.

52,"They describe it as a kind of ""jet stream"" - a fast-flowing river of liquid iron that is surging westwards under Alaska and Siberia.
The moving mass of metal has been inferred from measurements made by Europe’s Swarm satellites.
This trio of spacecraft are currently mapping Earth's magnetic field to try to understand its fundamental workings.
The scientists say the jet is the best explanation for the patches of concentrated field strength that the satellites observe in the northern hemisphere.
""This jet of liquid iron is moving at about fifty kilometres per year,"" explained Dr Chris Finlay from the National Space Institute at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU Space).
“That might not sound like a lot to you on Earth's surface, but you have to remember this a very dense liquid metal and it takes a huge amount of energy to move this thing around and that's probably the fastest motion we have anywhere within the solid Earth,” he told BBC News.
Dr Finlay was speaking here at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in San Francisco, just ahead of the official publication of the research in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Most people will be familiar with the atmospheric jet stream - the high-altitude, rapidly flowing belt of air on which aeroplanes ride to get to their destination more quickly.
Dr Finlay and colleagues want us to envision something similar but made of metal and 3,000km down, under our feet.
They assess the jet to be about 420km wide, and say it wraps half-way around the planet.
Its behaviour will be critical to the generation and maintenance of the global magnetic field, they add.
“It's likely that the jet stream has been in play for hundreds of millions of years,"" said Dr Phil Livermore from Leeds University, UK, and the lead author on the journal paper.
In the paper, the team puts forward a model to explain the jet.
The scientists say the feature probably aligns to a boundary between two different regions in the core.
They call this boundary the ""tangent cylinder"". They imagine this as a tube sitting around the solid inner core, running along Earth’s rotation axis.
When liquid iron approaches the boundary from both sides, it gets squeezed out sideways to form the jet, which then hugs the imaginary tube.
""Of course, you need a force to move fluid towards the tangent cylinder,"" said Prof Rainer Hollerbach, also from Leeds and another co-author on the paper.
""This could be provided by buoyancy, or perhaps more likely from changes in the magnetic field within the core.""
Although the team believes it understands how wide and how long the jet is, the depth to which it descends is far from certain.
Dr Livermore told BBC News: ""It currently wraps about 180 degrees around the tangent cylinder.  Although observations only constrain the jet stream on the edge of the core, our theoretical understanding suggests that the jet could in principle go very deep indeed - possibly in fact all the way down to the edge of the core in the southern hemisphere (i.e. at the other end of the tangent cylinder).""
That the team can make such inferences speaks to the impressive capabilities of the Swarm constellation.
Launched in November 2013, the European Space Agency satellites are providing unparalleled insights into the structure and behaviour of Earth's magnetic field.
With their highly sensitive instruments, they are gradually teasing apart the field's various components - from the dominant signal coming from the movement of iron in the outer core to the almost imperceptible contribution made by ocean currents.
It is  hoped the Swarm satellites’ data could ultimately tell us why Earth’s magnetic field has been weakening in recent centuries.
Scientists have speculated we could be on the cusp of a polarity reversal, which would see North become South, and South become North.
This occurs every few hundred thousand years.

58,"Will he be less outspoken? Will he temper his Twitter tirades? Will he back down from his calls for a Muslim ban?
Maybe. Maybe not.
But there are some significant ways Mr Trump is already altering his campaign strategy - sometimes in direct conflict with promises and assertions he made during his long, successful race to the top of the Republican Party.
Here are five.
Mr Trump has repeatedly boasted that he was paying for his campaign out of his own personal fortune.
""By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists,"" he posted on Facebook back in September. ""I am only working for the people of the US!""
Even though that's not exactly true - Mr Trump was loaning his campaign money and could someday pay it back, in addition to raising funds through donations - it was a central part of his pitch to those put off by the current political system.
Now, however, all pretence is gone. Mr Trump announced he's hired a veteran money man - a former Goldman Sachs partner, no less - as his national finance chairman. And on Tuesday he reached an agreement with the Republican Party to conduct joint fundraising through a network of committees that can take donations of up to $449,400 (Â£307,850) per person.
Mr Trump's move is an acknowledgement that he would be hard-pressed to self-finance a general election campaign, which could cost more than $1bn. He's wealthy - but he's not that wealthy.
Mr Trump has repeatedly insisted campaign-funded opinion polls are a waste of money.
""I don't have pollsters,"" he said last August. ""I don't want to be unreal. I want to be me. I have to be me. You know, we have enough of that in Washington, with pollsters telling everybody what to say and everybody being controlled by the special interests, and the lobbyists, et cetera, and the donors.""
In fact, Mr Trump was dismissive of the whole idea of data-driven campaigns - including President Barack Obama's winning presidential bids.
""Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine, and I think the same is true with me,"" he told the Associated Press.
That was before the Trump campaign hired Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, a veteran of the presidential campaigns of Rand Paul, Rick Perry and Bob Dole and a host of other state-level candidates.
Accurate, focused polling can serve as a presidential campaign's eyes and ears. It provides detailed information that helps a candidate's team determine where and how to spend resources.
At least that's what high-paid professional political pollsters will tell their candidates. And now Donald Trump is listening.
Like many Republicans, Mr Trump loved to make fun of Mr Obama's reliance on Teleprompters during public events.
""I've always said, if you run for president, you shouldn't be allowed to use Teleprompters,"" he said in October. ""Because you don't even know if the guy's smart.""
Part of Mr Trump's appeal was his off-the-cuff style. He could say anything at any time, no matter how controversial - compared to controlled, careful career politicians like Hillary Clinton.
""I watched Hillary the other day, and she has the biggest teleprompters I've ever seen,"" he said in January. ""In fact, if you're sitting on that side of the room or that side of the room you can't see her because when they are outside, they are painted black and you can't even see her.""
Then Mr Trump used a Teleprompter to deliver a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March. And he used one to give a foreign policy address in April.
His campaign has said that more substantive, scripted speeches are in store, including on the military, education reforms and the Supreme Court.
This, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told the Washington Post, represents ""the natural maturation of the campaign"".
Over the course of his primary campaign Mr Trump hasn't been afraid to pick fights with fellow conservatives. He memorably sparred with Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly in the first Republican debate in August. He repeatedly criticised his party's foreign policy establishment. And he relentlessly disparaged the Republican Party leaders.
""They win their election, and they go to Washington, and they're with their wife or husband, and they say: 'Look at the beautiful columns. I don't want to leave this place, this is so beautiful,'"" Mr Trump said of Republican politicians in December. ""And they let us down.""
Now Trump has reunited with Kelly in a make-nice Fox interview. He's given a foreign-policy speech to a Washington think tank. He's made the rounds on Capitol Hill and ""planted seeds"" with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.
On Wednesday afternoon he even had a closed-door meeting with the dean of the conservative foreign-policy establishment, Henry Kissinger.
In the past Republicans have pivoted from the right to the political middle. Mr Trump, it seems, is pivoting from the outside to the inside.
On Wednesday Mr Trump released his much anticipated list of potential Supreme Court nominees. For an unconventional candidate, it was decidedly conventional.
While one judge, Don Willett of Texas, has an affinity for Twitter that almost rivals Mr Trump's, the list - eight men, three women, all white - is only surprising for its adherence to conservative orthodoxy.
It looks like it could have been the product of the right-wing Heritage Foundation. In fact, it largely was.
All of the names are judges currently on either state or federal courts, even though there is no constitutional requirement that Supreme Court nominees even be lawyers.
While no one was expecting Mr Trump to suggest Hulk Hogan or Sarah Palin for the high court, his list looks a lot like business as usual for a Republican presidential candidate.
That may be just he way he wants it - but it's also not exactly what his primary campaign was all about.

63,"At Turf Moor on Saturday, Burnley and West Brom played out a game in which the ball was in play for only 160 seconds more than it was out.
Though these are early days, no Premier League match so far this season has seen less action.
Two months ago, football's lawmakers revealed they were considering scrapping 45-minute halves, instead introducing two periods of 30 minutes, during which the clock would be stopped every time the ball went out.
The proposal, the International Football Association Board said, was one of a number of options to deter football's ""negativities"".
So would the rule have benefited supporters at Premier League matches so far this season? In a word, yes.
Of 19 top-flight games across the opening two weekends of the campaign, the ball has been in play for more than an hour in only two of them.
And no game has featured more than 61 minutes of play.
Food for thought for fans and lawmakers alike.
Here's the rest of the key Premier League statistics from the weekend.
It was a landmark weekend for Wayne Rooney as he joined Alan Shearer in the 200 Premier League goals club with his strike against Manchester City on Monday.
Here's how and when he has scored them.
Rooney has some way to go to beat former Newcastle and Blackburn striker Shearer's record of 260 goals, although his goal at Etihad Stadium was his fifth in his past eight Premier League games.
If he can keep that up then who knows...
... try, try again?
Well doing just that doesn't appear to be yielding results in the Premier League so far this season.
Harry Kane must have some sort of pox on him that prevents him from scoring in August, and it's hard not to sympathise as everything conspired to deny him a goal against Chelsea on Sunday.
He's attempted 14 shots so far this term - no player has managed more - all without reward.
""Obviously my decision not to read the British press was one of the best I ever made in my life.""
Judging by the above quote, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was perhaps getting a little tired of the criticism of his side's defending before they beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Saturday.
It was a welcome clean sheet after the Reds conceded three in their Premier League opener against Watford and then let in a late goal in the midweek 2-1 Champions League play-off win at Hoffenheim. But is their defence really a problem?
On the face of it, the statistics suggest it is. No team has made more errors that have led to goals than Liverpool since 2012, while the Reds have not managed to concede fewer than 40 goals a season since 2009-10.
A concern, no doubt, for a side with title ambitions. Only once in the past seven seasons has the Premier League been won by a side that has shipped 40 goals or more - Manchester United in 2012-13 (43).
However, things appear to be going in the right direction under Klopp. Liverpool conceded eight fewer goals last season than they did in the German's first at Anfield, while Saturday's result against Palace was a fifth clean sheet from their past six Premier League games, as many as in the previous 21.
The run of four clean sheets in Liverpool's final four games of last season came with Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren in the side. When they are able to start together, Liverpool are generally rock solid at the back - of the 18 league games they started last season, the Reds lost just once and kept eight clean sheets.
Possession football. Two words that will have Arsenal fans shuddering.
The Gunners often come out on top of the possession statistics but their game at Stoke on Saturday perhaps took the biscuit. With 77.3%, Arsene Wenger's side 'enjoyed' their highest possession figure in a single Premier League match since the 2003-04 season - yet lost 1-0.
It was a similar story for Tottenham. Against Chelsea in their first Premier League home game at Wembley, they threw everything (possibly including the kitchen sink) at the opposition goal, dominating the possession statistics with 68% of the ball - but ended up on the wrong side of a 2-1 result.
Clearly Chelsea were taking a leaf out of Burnley's books. Last weekend, the Clarets had just 38% possession compared with 62% for the Blues, but came away with the victory.
Javier Hernandez did what Javier Hernandez does best on Saturday - score from inside the box.
The former Manchester United striker returned to English football by joining West Ham in the summer and scored in the Premier League for the first time since April 2014 with a brace against Southampton. Just like his strike against Newcastle 1,232 days ago, both of those goals came from within 18 yards.
In fact, not one of Hernandez's 39 goals in the Premier League have been scored from outside the area, making him one of the most lethal close-range finishers to have played in England's top flight.
Hernandez's failure to score from outside of the box is not for the want of trying.
Against Southampton, the Mexico international had three shots on goal. Two from inside the box which ended up in the back of the net, the other from long range which, you've guessed it, went wide.
The fox in the box is very much in style. Of the 50 goals scored in the Premier League so far this season, only four have come from outside the area.
Life just continues to get better and better for Huddersfield fans.
The Terriers, back in the big time after a 45-year absence, made it two wins from two in the Premier League by beating Newcastle 1-0 on Sunday.
It means they are now only the third team in Premier League history to win their first two games following promotion. Bolton, in 2001-02, went to finish 16th and earn another stint in the top flight - but Hull City last season would go on to be relegated. A sign that the season is a marathon and not a sprint.
But perhaps youthful exuberance will see David Wagner's men continue to upset the odds. Huddersfield have named two of the four youngest starting XIs in the Premier League so far this season - and average age of 25 years and 143 days at Crystal Palace and 25 years 331 days against Newcastle.

64,"Twenty years ago today, Craig Brown's side faced England at Wembley at Euro 96 and encountered the kind of cruel fate that leaves a lasting regret.
Scotland were undone by misfortune and brilliance; two momentary interventions that extinguished their hopes. The performance overall was not bereft, which was in keeping with the tournament as a whole since Brown's team drew 0-0 with the Netherlands in the opening match and went on to defeat Switzerland 1-0.
Even so, the game still stands out in the long history of encounters between the Auld Enemy, for its circumstances, its drama and, to an extent, its heartache.
England needed to recover from a disappointing 1-1 draw with Switzerland in their opening game that exacerbated the criticism of the players. Manager Terry Venables had taken the squad to Hong Kong prior to the tournament, where some were pictured out drinking heavily.
Damage caused to the plane on the journey home brought further condemnation, while also building a siege mentality amongst the players and Venables, who had already announced he would be standing down after Euro 96 and would be succeeded by Glenn Hoddle.
Scotland were buoyed by holding the Dutch to a draw and although underdogs at Wembley, there was no sense of inferiority. Of the team that started the match, Colin Calderwood was at Tottenham, Colin Hendry had won the Premier League the year before with Blackburn (alongside England striker Alan Shearer), Gary McAllister was at Leeds and John Spencer was at Chelsea.
The rest of the team was made up of players from Aberdeen, Celtic and Rangers. For Scotland, naturally, the tie stirred memories of past excursions to Wembley and the fans mobilised en masse to London with a sense of living up to the zealous spirit of their predecessors.
The occasion worked with and against Scotland, though, since the England players were fired up by the historical significance of the game as much as the need to establish their worth at Euro 96. Before kick-off, England full-back Stuart Pearce could barely look at the Scots as they shook hands.
""You've got no friends when you play against a team like that,"" he later recalled.
It was a measure of Scotland's first-half performance that England used the interval to change their line-up. The game was still tied at 0-0, which suited Brown's side because the longer the game remained in the balance, the more doubt would enter the minds of the England players.
Venables was too wily to be outfoxed, though. Recognising that his side was not dominating possession enough to threaten, he brought on midfielder Jamie Redknapp at half-time. Eight minutes into the second half, Redknapp was involved in the move that resulted in Gary Neville crossing for Shearer to open the scoring with a header.
Scotland were not subdued by the goal, and Gordon Durie's header forced David Seaman to desperately claw the ball away.
Durie was involved in the next key moment, when he reached Stuart McCall's cross ahead of Tony Adams and was knocked over by the Arsenal defender's sliding challenge.
McAllister placed the ball on the spot, but as he ran to take his penalty kick, the ball rolled slightly. It was enough of a movement for Seaman to notice it and briefly wonder if the Scotland midfielder would stop and restart his run.
Instead, he struck the ball firmly but relatively straight, and Seaman blocked the spot-kick. McAllister later insisted that the movement of the ball was not an excuse for missing, but also insisted that if he had scored, he was convinced Scotland's momentum would have driven them to victory.
Instead, there was only further pain. Within 90 seconds the ball was worked out towards Paul Gascoigne, who lobbed it over Hendry then caught it on the volley to score past his Rangers team-mate, Andy Goram.
""You've got to hold your hand up at times and say it was a great piece of skill,"" Hendry later recalled.
Gascoigne ran to the byline and lay on his back while England players sprayed water into his mouth, mimicking the dentist's chair drinking game that had been caught on camera in Hong Kong.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The midfielder was typically mercurial, since it was his birthday the England players had been out celebrating in Hong Kong. He had been quiet in the opening match, too, and the Scotland bench were convinced Venables was about to replace him before he scored.
The England boss understood Gascoigne better than most, though, having worked with him at Tottenham as well.
The night before the Scotland game, Gascogine couldn't sleep and visited Venables in his hotel room. He confessed to being worried that he would not be selected for the game, and Venables told him he wouldn't be.
Even with the player in tears, Venables left him thinking that for 45 minutes, before telling him he was playing and to get off to bed to sleep.
Some of the Scotland players left the pitch feeling they had let their country down, while for many of the England players it was relief that underpinned their joy.
They went on to defeat the Netherlands 4-1, but Patrick Kluivert's consolation goal for the Dutch 12 minutes before the end meant Scotland were knocked out on goals scored, despite both countries finishing on four points and with a goal difference of minus one.
England reached the semi-final, only to lose to Germany on penalties. Their defeat was overseen by Berti Vogts, who led his country to the title, and then six years later became manager of Scotland. A summary is",It remains a game that Scotland cannot escape.,None,generation

67,"The 17-year-old, who cannot be named, committed the offence while on a community payback order he received for having sex with a 12-year-old girl when he was 14.
A court heard that he had sex with the 13-year-old in the grounds of Dundee and Angus College.
The meeting was arranged on Snapchat.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard how the pair had met through mutual friends in 2015 but there was no contact between them until June 2016 when he added her on the social networking app.
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson said that when they met they chatted for some time and the accused was immediately affectionate towards the girl, kissing and cuddling her.
""He told her he had been 'choking to go with her' and they then walked towards the college,"" Ms Robertson said.
""He repeatedly asked her if she would have sex with him, and when in the grounds of the college he said 'have sex with me there' and pointed to a grassy area.
""They went there and had sex, after which he stood up and said he had to leave.""
The girl's mother picked her up before the 13-year-old told her what had happened the next day.
She then told a counsellor who called in police.
The teenager was given a community payback order last year for his previous sex offence conviction.
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael told him that custody was the only option this time because he did not appear to have learned from his previous community sentence.
The 17-year-old pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act.
Defence solicitor Katrina Clark urged the court to impose a second community payback order instead of a jail term.
She said: ""He's aware he faces more time in custody.
""The more effective way forward for him would be through the intensive project outlined for him in the social work reports. That wouldn't be an easy option.
""This could be dealt with by a non-custodial sentence due to his age, the period he has spent in custody on remand and his acceptance of his guilt at an early stage.""
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael imposed a one-year sentence of detention on the teenager, placed him on the sex offenders register for 10 years and imposed a sexual offences prevention order for six years during which time he will be monitored by specialist police officers.
He said: ""Unfortunately from your perspective no other method than custody is appropriate.

69,"One of them, the blogger Prof Michael Pettis of the Beijing Business School, had earned kudos as one of the first to predict the sharp slowdown in China's economy seen over the last year.
The other was the Economist. The magazine, that is.
Their bet - for a bottle of booze - was over whether China's economy was about to run out of puff.
The country has managed 9.9% growth on average over the past 35 years, but Prof Pettis thinks that the growth rate will fall to a measly (by Chinese standards) 3% this decade.
The more gung-ho Economist by contrast was forecasting that China would stay on course to overtake the US as the world's biggest economy by 2018.
""China has grown very rapidly in the last 30 years, but it has been following a model that is not unique,"" says Prof Pettis.
""In the 50s and 60s almost everyone 'knew' that the Soviet Union would overtake the US in the 70s - even Jack Kennedy - but it didn't happen. Instead, the Russian economy got mired in debt and years of stagnation.""
Other examples include the Brazilian economic ""miracle"" of the 1960s and 1970s, says Prof Pettis, that ended in a 1982 financial crisis and a ""lost decade"" of growth, or Japan's rapid ascent up until its own 1990 crisis and subsequent two-decade stagnation.
What these countries have in common is an enormous level of government-led investment - in roads, trains, schools, hospitals, education and training.
""You can get tremendous growth by keeping investment levels high,"" he explains. ""And in the early days, growth is healthy and sustainable.
""But later... you very easily reach a point where you can't identify economically viable projects any more, and you overshoot and start misallocating capital in a pretty significant way. That's when debt rises more quickly than the economy's capacity to service it.""
China has been overinvesting perhaps since the 1990s, according to Prof Pettis, and certainly in the last five to 10 years.
""A lot of growth is fake,"" he says. ""If you spend $1bn building an airport, it generates the same amount of [economic output] today whether or not anyone actually uses the airport.
""If no-one uses it, however, the economic value created by the airport is not enough to repay the debt, and so future growth must decline as wealth is transferred from some other part of the economy to pay down the debt.""
He says that there are three main sources of growth for China. The first, investment, is already exhausted. The second, exports, are also no longer viable, as China's main export markets in Europe and the US are depressed, and China's trade surplus has become politically contentious in those countries.
The third option is for ordinary Chinese people to increase their spending on consumer products and services.
But here the numbers just don't stack up. Consumers account for just a third of spending in China - an unprecedentedly low share for any major economy - while investment accounts for a whopping half of the economy.
If investment just stagnates - and in developed capitalist economies it usually falls after such a long boom - then, with consumer spending starting from such a low base, China would have to pull off the biggest consumer spending boom in history just to maintain overall economic growth at the planned rate of 7%-8%.
But the kinds of policies that would be needed to pull this off - such as paying Chinese households more interest on their savings, paying Chinese workers higher wages at the cost of state-owned company profits, or providing Chinese migrant workers with decent social benefits - run up against powerful politically-connected interests.
Prof Pettis is doubtful that it can be done.
""The bet's still on,"" says Simon Cox, Asia economics editor at the Economist. ""Though it won't be resolved till the end of the decade.""
The Economist's side of the bet - that China will overtake the US by 2018 - was the default scenario in an interactive forecaster that they stuck on their website to let readers play God with the Chinese economy.
""[2018] seems quite soon, but then you look at the individual assumptions, and they don't seem too whacky.""
One crucial assumption is the exchange rate. Mr Cox's team expects the yuan to strengthen against the dollar, even while prices rise more quickly in China, meaning that measured in dollars China's economy could still grow very rapidly, even if in reality the country actually slows down.
""I agree with Pettis on a whole range of things. I think the investment rate is too high, and it is difficult to invest wisely when you are doing it so fast. A lot of investment, especially by state-owned companies, is inefficient.""
Where he parts company with the Beijing-based professor is on the question of whether China is running out of decent investment opportunities.
China is still a very underdeveloped country, and he says the capital stock per worker - the quantity of buildings, machinery, infrastructure, vehicles and suchlike relative to the population size - is still very low by Western or Japanese standards.
He also says that while Prof Pettis is focused on where spending will come from, what really matters for long-term growth is China's ability to improve skills and adopt new technology.
Will China fall flat on its face?
China's economic miracle
China businessmen's stories
""China is very good at absorbing knowhow from the rest of the world. It is much more open to foreign investment than Korea and Japan were. And it has a large domestic market, so foreign producers have an incentive to tutor local suppliers in their products.""
Mr Cox confesses to being an old-school Keynesian. As such, he believes that even if - as Prof Pettis believes - China does run into the same problem as the West, that ordinary citizens are not increasing their spending fast enough, the government can cope.
""If the alternative is unemployment, it is better to employ people to do something, even if it is not very value-adding.
""Lots of people are still living in old housing units left over from the 1990s, so it would be worthwhile employing people to build replacements for those. Unfortunately, a lot of labour instead gets wasted on building tasteless villas for the super-wealthy.

70,"The two firms should be barred from any US mergers and acquisitions, according to a House Intelligence Committee report.
The panel says the firms failed to allay fears about their association with China's government and military.
Huawei and ZTE denied the accusations in front of the panel in September.
On Monday ZTE issued a statement insisting its equipment met all US standards and posed no threat.
""ZTE has set an unprecedented standard for co-operation by any Chinese company with a congressional investigation,"" China's Xinhua news agency quoted the firm as saying.
How China became the US election bogeyman
Huawei's vice-president, William Plummer, said the latest accusations were ""dangerous political distractions"".
""Purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignores technical and commercial realities, recklessly threatens American jobs and innovation, does nothing to protect national security.""
While the House Intelligence report stopped short of calling for a boycott of the firms' mobile phone products, it was highly critical of the two companies.
""China has the means, opportunity and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes,"" the report says.
""Based on available classified and unclassified information, Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems.""
The panel said their investigation had received credible allegations from current and former Huawei employees of bribery and corruption, discriminatory behaviour and copyright infringement.
Republican committee chairman Mike Rogers said they had passed on information to the FBI to investigate the allegations.
""We've come to the conclusion, unfortunately, they are not private entities,"" Mr Rogers said on Monday.
On Sunday, Mr Rogers delivered a blunt verdict to the 60 Minutes programme on US network CBS.
""If I were an American company today... and you are looking at Huawei, I would find another vendor if you care about your intellectual property, if you care about your consumers' privacy, and you care about the national security of the United States of America,"" he said.
Among the report's recommendations were to exclude any Huawei or ZTE equipment or component parts from being used by government contractors, as well both companies becoming ""more transparent and responsive to US legal obligations"".
China's Foreign Ministry urged the US to ""set aside prejudices"" regarding the two firms.
""Chinese telecoms companies have been developing their international business based on market economy principles,"" ministry spokesman Hong Lei said.
""Their investment in the United States embodies the mutually beneficial nature of Sino-American economic and trade relations.""
Huawei was started by Ren Zhengfei, a former member of the People's Liberation Army, in 1987.
As the firm has grown to become one of the largest global players in the sector, fears about its ties with the Chinese military have frequently surfaced.
There have been concerns and allegations that it was helping China gather information on foreign states and companies, charges that the firm has denied.
Last year, its purchase of American computer company 3Leaf systems, was rejected by a US security panel.
Earlier this year, it along with ZTE, faced allegations that some of their equipment had been installed with codes to relay sensitive information back to China.
Senior executives from the two companies denied those allegations when they appeared before US lawmakers in September.
ZTE is also facing accusations it sold US telecoms equipment to Iran, in breach of US sanctions. Telecoms giant Cisco on Monday ended its relationship with ZTE, Reuters reported, after its equipment was included in the Tehran deal.
This latest report comes in the midst of a US presidential campaign in which China has become a hot topic.
Both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney have pledged to increase the pressure on Beijing on issues ranging from China's currency policy to state subsidies for Chinese firms.
Earlier this month, Mr Obama signed an order blocking a deal by a Chinese firm, Ralls Corp, to acquire four wind farm projects near a US naval facility in Oregon.
It was the first foreign investment to be blocked in the US for 22 years.
The Chinese firm has since sued Mr Obama, alleging the US government overstepped its authority. A summary is","Chinese telecom firms Huawei and ZTE pose a security threat to the US, a congressional panel has warned after an investigation into the two companies.",None,generation
71,"Labour MP Yvette Cooper said it was not ""appropriate"" or ""statesmanlike"" for him to use such language about a ""complex and sensitive"" issue.
Shadow minister Kate Green said it was ""offensive, hurtful... and divisive"".
Mr Cameron said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had told the migrants at the camp ""they could all come to Britain"".
At the weekend, the Labour leader visited the Grande-Synthe Camp, near Dunkirk, and The Jungle in Calais, where more than 7,000 people are sleeping rough, describing conditions there as ""disgraceful"".
Jeremy Corbyn had a good go at David Cameron over the Google tax deal, using a crowd-sourced question from Jeff (or possibly Geoff), who wanted to know whether he could join a scheme allowing him to pay the same rate of tax as the internet giant.
But some commentators felt the Labour leader lost focus when he switched to other subjects for his final two questions.
""We've had no answer on Google, and no answers on Jeff,"" said Mr Corbyn, before turning to what he calls the ""bedroom tax"" and a High Court ruling that it is ""discriminatory"". For his final question, he called on the PM to launch an inquiry into arms export licences to Saudi Arabia amid UN reports of coalition air strikes on civilians in Yemen.
The prime minister responded to that last point by saying the UK had some of the strictest rules for arms exports in the world. He added that Britain was ""not part of Saudi-led operations"" in Yemen.
But it was one of those weeks when reaction to what was said at PMQs overshadowed anything that was said during the session, as Labour seized on Mr Cameron's ""bunch of migrants"" comment.
Mr Cameron was coming to the end of a clash with Jeremy Corbyn about Google's tax deal with the government, when he decided, as he often does, to broaden out his attack to other issues.
The Labour leader had just accused him of failing to stand up to Google.
Mr Cameron replied: ""The shadow chancellor's pointing - the idea that those two right honourable gentlemen would stand up to anyone in this regard is laughable.
""Look at the record over the last week - they met with the unions and they gave them flying pickets.
""They met with the Argentinians, they gave them the Falkland Islands.
""They met with a bunch of migrants in Calais, they said they could all come to Britain.
""The only people they never stand up for are the British people and hard-working taxpayers.""
Several Labour MPs objected to Mr Cameron's ""bunch of migrants"" comments on Twitter, describing them as ""shameful"" and ""inflammatory"" and the PM as ""odious"".
A Labour spokesman said Mr Cameron's use of the phrase ""demonstrates an attitude that is wholly unacceptable to a humanitarian crisis on our doorstep"".
Yvette Cooper, who is chairing Labour's refugee task force, said Mr Cameron should use ""much more statesmanship-like"" language on such a ""complex and sensitive"" issue, particularly given ongoing commemorations of Holocaust victims.
She got to her feet immediately after Prime Minister's Questions to raise a point of order
She asked Commons Speaker John Bercow to ask Mr Cameron to ""withdraw"" the comment.
Mr Bercow told Ms Cooper: ""You speak with enormous experience in this House and I respect what you say.
""I completely identify and empathise with your observations about Holocaust Memorial Day, which you and I on other occasions have marked at events together - so I take what you say extremely seriously.""
He ruled that it was not ""disorderly"" or ""un-Parliamentary"" but added ""people will make their own assessments of this matter"".
The prime minister's spokesman said the government had spent Â£1.2bn to help hundreds of thousands of refugees in camps in the region and he said Labour's approach would ""open the door and provide an incentive for more to come to Calais"".
Asked if he considered the phrase ""bunch of migrants"" to be pejorative the spokesman said ""the PM thinks that the key thing here is getting the policy right"".
Mr Cameron was accused by some opponents of using the ""bunch of migrants"" phrase to distract attention from criticism of the Google agreement.
But this was dismissed as ""silly and playing cheap politics"" by small business minister Anna Soubry
She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One Mr Cameron had been using the ""language of ordinary people"", adding ""we all use slang"" in the heat of the moment.
David Cameron insisted he has done more than any other prime minister to crack down on aggressive tax avoidance and blamed Labour for failures in collecting taxes from large multinationals.
Mr Corbyn claimed Google was paying an effective tax rate of 3% - and accused the government of sending out mixed messages, with Chancellor George Osborne initially describing the deal as a ""major success"" before No 10 rowed back, calling it a ""step forward"", while, he said, London mayor Boris Johnson labelled it ""derisory"".
Mr Cameron then went on to explain the measures the Government has put in place to tackle tax avoidance and evasion before claiming the tax rate for Google under Labour was ""0%"".
Mr Corbyn also pointed to a series of meetings Google had had with Government ministers.
""Millions of people are this week filling in their tax returns to get them in by the 31st,"" he said.
""They have to send the form back, they do not get the option of 25 meetings with 17 ministers to decide what their rate of tax is.
""Many people going to their HMRC offices or returning them online this week will say this - 'Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary, small businesses and self-employed workers?""'
Mr Cameron brushed off the criticism by launching into an attack on all the things Labour did not stand up to, including migrants.
Firstly: George Osborne risked sounded far too content when he hailed the deal as a ""victory"" and a ""major success"". Government spokesmen were reluctant to repeat his verdict.
Secondly: Labour reacted quickly and managed to get a hearing. Their message sounded louder than their internal disputes, for a change.
Thirdly: voters care. The perception international firms get a better deal than ordinary people is toxic.
HMRC collects tax, not ministers, and the government says it has acted and got results where Labour did not.
But few politicians ever caught the mood of a nation declaring themselves happy with a big business's tax return.
Mr Cameron began Prime Minister's Questions by announcing that a ""striking"" memorial to the victims of Nazi atrocities is to be erected beside Parliament, in Victoria Tower Gardens, where a number of monuments already stand.
Downing Street said an international design competition will be launched in the coming weeks and the memorial built by the end of 2017.
""It will stand beside Parliament as a permanent statement of our values as a nation and will be something for our children to visit for generations to come,"" Mr Cameron said.
""It is right that our whole country should stand together to remember the darkest hour of humanity.""
The SNP again challenged the prime minister to help those women born in the 1950s, affected by pension equalisation, with the party's leader at Westminster using both of his questions to press the point.
He called on David Cameron to respect a Parliamentary decision to immediately introduce transitional arrangements for those women negatively impacted (the vote was non-binding and does not compel ministers to act).
Mr Cameron did not address the point directly, but claimed the introduction of a single tier pension at Â£155 a week would end discrimination because ""so many women retiring will get so much more in their pension"".
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron is guaranteed one question at PMQs every month and he used his latest opportunity to urge the prime minister to do more to alleviate the refugee crisis facing Europe.
""The only way to challenge a crisis of that magnitude is by starting working with our European colleagues at the heart of a united Europe,"" he said.
He urged Mr Cameron to ""welcome in and provide a home"" to 3,000 unaccompanied children as recommended by campaigners.
In response, Mr Cameron said no country in Europe had been ""more generous"" in supporting refugee camps in the Middle East but the UK would not be taking part in the EU's refugee relocation and resettlement schemes as it was not in its national interest.

72,"The decision drops the German to third place, behind team-mate Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen and cuts his points lead over Hamilton to one.
Mercedes were found to have gone beyond the degree permitted to help a driver solve a technical problem.
They broke a rule saying: ""The driver must drive the car alone and unaided.""
Mercedes have lodged an intention to appeal against the decision.
The Formula 1 rules were changed this year to introduce restrictions on how much teams can help drivers while they are out on track.
Teams are allowed to intervene if the car has a ""critical problem if a failure of a component or system is imminent and potentially terminal"".
Race stewards found Mercedes were allowed to give Rosberg instructions on the settings he needed to resolve the problem.
But they should not have responded to his subsequent question on whether he should then change gear so the car went straight through seventh gear.
Rosberg's engineer Tony Ross replied to the German's information that he had a gearbox problem with the words: ""Driver default 1-0-1, chassis default 0-1, chassis default 0-1. Avoid seventh gear, Nico, avoid seventh gear.""
Rosberg then asked: ""What does that mean, I have to shift through it?
Engineer: ""Affirm Nico, you need to shift through it. Affirm, you need to shift through it.""
Both Mercedes F1 team boss Toto Wolff and his opposite number at Red Bull, Christian Horner, questioned the need for the rules restricting driver assistance.
Horner said: ""The rule is rubbish. It doesn't make a great deal of sense. But the rules are the rules.
""The cars are technically very complex and you can understand why Mercedes would want to give that message to keep their driver running.
""It's a team sport and the cars are a lot more complicated than they were even four years ago for the drivers to work out what they should and shouldn't be doing.
""The question going forward is are these rules right for F1? That's a different question.""
Wolff, speaking before the decision to penalise Mercedes, drew parallels between this situation and one in last weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, when Force India did not tell their driver Sergio Perez that he had a critical brake problem and the Mexican crashed out on the final lap.
Wolff said: ""We see that those rules maybe need a re-think between the FIA and the teams to maybe go more into detail on what is allowed or not because not communicating at all, you might as well unplug the radio and throw it out of the car. It is part of driving since a long time.""
However, the rule is a pet project of FIA president Jean Todt and he has so far been deaf to questions about its suitability.

""The club will continue to work towards a position where we can announce a more permanent solution in early January.""
Rotherham, who are bottom of the table and have lost 13 of their past 15 matches, host 23rd-placed Wigan on Boxing Day and 21st-placed Burton three days later.

Rotherham have had five permanent managers and three caretakers since the start of last season, with Neil Redfearn, Neil Warnock, Alan Stubbs and Jackett all having spells in the job following Steve Evans' departure in September 2015.

76,"Owen Creaney, from Lurgan, was found dead on 5 July 2014.
Shauneen Boyle, 25, and Stephen Thomas Hughes, 29, are jointly charged with his murder.
A friend of Ms Boyle's said she received a text on Friday 4 July which said Ms Boyle was ""in trouble"".
Mairead McGuigan told the jury at Belfast Crown Court that she later phoned Ms Boyle.
""She said she got into a fight with Owen, she had went mad, she had beat a fella up after getting into an argument and she jumped on his stomach and his head. She might have said that he was in a bad way,"" she said.
""She said there was blood all over his face. She said his face was busted open.''
Ms McGuigan said Ms Boyle phoned her about 21:00 and asked her to call round to Mr Hughes's house after work.
""She asked me to bring round my hoover and my carpet cleaner as she said there was a stain on the white carpet,'' she said
The witness said she called to Mr Hughes's house at Moyraverty Court, Craigavon, about 21:35 and told a prosecution barrister that she took a seat on the sofa in the living next to Ms Boyle while Mr Hughes remained standing in front of them.
""They were drinking. Shauneen said: 'I got into a fight with Owen Creaney over my dad',"" she Ms McGuigan said.
""Stephen said nothing. I asked him why he didn't break it up. He said he was afraid and said he had got his blinds broken.""
She told the court she was about to leave when she heard noises coming from upstairs and realised Mr Creaney was up there.
Ms Boyle told her he had been sleeping for 28 hours and was drunk after consuming alcohol.
Ms McGuigan followed the pair upstairs and saw Mr Creaney lying on a sofa.
""He was making funny breathing noises, like heavy breathing. Shauneen said he was sleeping. He was like bruised with yellow bruising. There was foam coming out of his mouth,"" she said.
""I told them to get the police, that this man has a broken rib. Shauneen said Stephen was afraid of the police coming to the house. I said he definitely has a broken rib and she said Owen had drank a litre of vodka and was lying sleeping.''
She told the court that the pair told her they had showered Mr Creaney following the fight to ""to try and bring him round"" and had changed him and washed his clothes.'
Ms McGuigan left the property and told a male friend what had happened.
She said she was in contact with Ms Boyle the following morning.
Ms McGuigan said she asked Ms Boyle about Mr Creaney, to which she replied: ""He is dead.'' I said: 'Get that man to the hospital now.''
""Shauneen said: 'It's too late. There is nothing more we can do for him'. But I don't think she was telling the truth.''
She said that during the phone call, she overheard a conversation between the pair talking about an ""empty wheelie bin"".

77,"These aren't real products, of course, but an art project poking fun at Asia's obsession with beauty and its propensity for conspicuous consumption.
The display was created by the inaugural cohort of Singapore-based graduates of the Glasgow School of Art, which set up its first overseas campus here in 2011.
The Scottish arts institution is looking to expand its course offerings over the next few years and aims to help develop the city-state's creative scene.
""We hope that we can use this platform and build relationships with other parts of the region using it as a hub,"" said its director, Tom Inns.
""To be an international art schools you've got to understand how the world works in terms of regions and different thinking and different cultures.
""It is only by being there that you can only really begin to understand that. You can't understand that from a distance.""
But if the experience of the last foreign creative arts school to open up in Singapore is anything to go by, there may be some challenges ahead.
This summer, the editing labs and sound engineering stations at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in Asia will fall silent for good.
The campus, set upon three-acres of prime property in central Singapore, is closing less than 10 years after opening due to millions of dollars of debts.
NYU still operates two degree-granting, liberal arts research university campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.
""Despite its significant creative success, the Tisch Asia campus failed to become financially sustainable,"" says a university statement.
John Beckman, vice president for public affairs at New York University said that reflecting back, they had ""learned a number of lessons"" from their experience.
""Academically and artistically, the Tisch Asia campus was a tremendous success,"" he said. ""But academic excellence is also expensive"".
""We were too optimistic about prospective enrolments both internationally and locally, the latter of which has been pivotal to many global academic initiatives.
""We operate on the principle that we will not direct money from the campus in New York to sustain global operations, we should have factored in a greater degree of support needed beyond tuition, especially in the critical start-up years.""
Mr Beckman added that Tisch Asia ""as a relatively small, independent graduate arts conservatory, was an ambitious enterprise"".
""The general lesson we learned was that it would have been better to have developed such a significant project as part of - and not separate from - our university-wide global efforts.""
The closure was not just a high-profile and expensive failure for the school, but for the Singapore government, which had invited them to set up here in 2007.
However, Tisch Asia is not alone.
In recent years, Australia's University of New South Wales, the University of Las Vegas Nevada and Warwick University have all exited, mostly due to financial reasons.
Singapore used to publicise its aim of becoming a global education hub, saying it hoped the sector would ultimately contribute up to 5% of its gross domestic product (GDP).
More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch
The Economic Development Board (EDB), which seeks to bring investments to Singapore, launched the ""Global Schoolhouse"" project in 2002.
The scheme saw it offer millions of dollars in grants and subsidies to attract top names here. In many ways, it has been quite a success.
French business school INSEAD has been operating its satellite campus. American Ivy League university Yale also launched here, despite some controversy.
But following the high-profile failure of Tisch Asia and other foreign universities, it seems the government has changed its tune about attracting more entrants.
Alvin Tan, the EDB's assistant managing director of corporate development, says that in recent years the local higher education provision has increased in ""diversity and quality"" and he talks of any future incoming institutions as being a ""complement"" to strong local options.
A university's future in Singapore doesn't only come down to financial considerations, however.
The University of Chicago's Booth School of Business decided to relocate its campus from Singapore to Hong Kong in order to be situated closer to the China market.
William Kooser, the associate dean of global outreach at the University of Chicago said their lease in Singapore was expiring this year and that their strategy came up for review.
""There are a couple of things that schools need to understand before they decide to go overseas,"" said Mr Kooser.
""One is that it's not easy. It is not simply a matter of duplicating what you do in the United States and plopping it into another city.
""Two, you need to understand what it is you are trying to get out of the programme. Is it simply trying to create revenue? Or is it something beyond that?
""If it is simply to create revenue, if you don't to meet your revenue targets, it's easy to pull out. If you are trying to achieve something else you are typically in it for the longer haul.""
Singapore is regularly cited for its high quality of life, political stability, low-tax environment and ease of doing business.
However, the city-state's rising cost of living has led to major issues for both foreign universities and students.
It is the most expensive country in the world, according to an annual survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit.
Singapore's booming property prices and strong currency has also translated into high rent and tuition fees.
Then there is the question of getting a job after graduation.
Singapore's labour market has tightened over the last few years, making it harder for foreigners to get job here.
One year after the Glasgow School of Art's first graduation ceremony, another group of students are preparing their final year projects.
It is a sweltering hot day and they are on campus despite it being a school holiday, listening to pop music while painting large wooden panels. Their enthusiasm is clear.
But like so many students at Tisch, the future of their campus may ultimately come down to dollars and cents. A summary is","On the shelves of ""Happy Mart,"" there are gleaming cans of ""instant nose jobs"", packets of ""Same Face"" cookies and boxes of ""Luxurios"" cereal.",None,generation
78,"Baroness Morgan said Labour is in a serious situation if it cannot reconnect with working class communities.
She said there ""probably was an element"" of Labour's Remain campaign starting too late.
""A lot of us were exhausted"", she told BBC Radio Wales.
Senior Welsh Labour sources have privately said they were wary of talking about Brexit before the assembly election in case it drove Eurosceptic supporters towards UKIP.

Corbyn's Labour set for heavy losses, says Stephen Kinnock
Asked if Labour's Remain campaign started too late, she told the Eye on Wales programme: ""I think there probably was an element of that.
""And don't forget in Wales we had the assembly elections where people were not talking about the European Union. We were focused absolutely on those assembly elections.""
She added: ""I think it was a mistake not to be talking about the European referendum in those assembly elections.""
Wales voted 52.5% to 47.5% for Brexit. Only five counting areas voted to Remain.
The strongest Leave votes were in Torfaen (60%) and Blaenau Gwent (62%) - two traditional Labour strongholds in the south Wales valleys.
The Welsh government has a programme to ""re-energise"" communities that voted to Leave, much of which would have been funded by EU money, Baroness Morgan said.
""The question for us now is how on Earth do we reorganise the economy without that European funding?"" she asked.
""Unless we find a way to reconnect with that working class element within our communities then I think the Labour party is in a serious situation in future"".
Labour won 29 seats at May's assembly election - a better result than many expected - but lost 7.6% of its share of the vote on the constituency ballot.

""I wasn't aware of the extent of the problem - and it is just fantastic that things are taking a turn for the better and incredibly so,"" he said.
The archbishop was referring to the impact of government-led programmes in several dozen villages in the region which focus on delaying marriage.
In this area, the lure of a bride price causes many families to push for early weddings. But there is another reason.
""Fear of abduction is also a factor,"" said Alemseged Weldegerima from the Ethiopian government's Bureau of Women, Children and Youth Affairs.
""We will try to stop abduction, not by using the police, but by increasing the awareness of the people.""
Beside a small eucalyptus plantation Archbishop Tutu was sharing a low wooden bench with two Elders who have broken the mould; the first woman to be president of Ireland, Mary Robinson, and the former prime minister of Norway, and ex-head of the World Health Organization, Gro Brundtland.
They listened to young unmarried girls with big dreams, as well as women who had no chance of getting an education after being married off at a young age.

""Prime minister,"" she replied without hesitation.  Look out Meles Zenawi!
Abay has joined a girls' club known as Berhane Hewan - Amharic for ""Light for Eve"".
She has learnt about issues which have prepared her to resist early marriage; personal health, HIV/Aids, and the medical complications associated with giving birth at a young age, like fistula.
Female circumcision is also discussed and in the 36 villages where the clubs have been set up, I am told fewer girls are now getting cut.
Beside the road several boys are playing table football. They seem to welcome the idea of delaying marriage.
""You can't afford to run a family when you're too young,"" said 20-year-old Tazab, who has no plans to wed any time soon.
""Also it's bad for a girl's health to have children too early,"" he says.
In a rectangular mud-walled building which serves as a meeting hall and classroom for the Berhane Hewan participants, I met 15-year-old Serkaddis Assefa.
""Because of the Berhane Hewan programme I know about the issue of early marriage. If I hadn't joined, I might have been married off already,"" she said.
Sitting alongside was her mother, Enguday Assefa, whose forth child was fast asleep on her back.
Around Ms Enguday's neck was part of her dowry payment; a coin bearing the face of Ethiopia's last emperor, Haile Selassie, and another of Queen Taitu, wife of the monarch Menelik II who died in 1913.
""I still feel bad when I think about my friends who now have jobs and have reached different positions,"" said Ms Enguday, who was forced to quit school and was already married with a child by the age of  15.
For the Elders, the behavioural change which has only happened in the last five years is worth celebrating.
""When Nelson Mandela brought us together at our first planning meeting he did say to us: 'Be bold, talk to those whom others won't talk to, be on the side of the most deprived, the most isolated, the most undervalued in society,'"" recalls Mrs Robinson.
""And in many ways those young girls, brides and mothers are very undervalued by their community and have very little sense of self-worth so the issue of child marriage, as far as I'm concerned, is a very good way of having an entry point into the effect of poverty.
""The effect of a lack of equality within communities, the effect of harmful traditional practices on the community - the effect of all the things that the Elders should be championing.""
Berhane Hewan started off with 700 girls and at its peak reached around 12,000 - just a small fraction of the vulnerable population.
While considered to be a successful initiative, the programme will need to be scaled up significantly to make a major difference in Ethiopia.
For the first time the girls here are starting to shape their own destinies.
The hope among the Elders is that lessons from Ethiopia's Amhara Region can be applied to other parts of the world where child marriage is common, like India.

But he is otherwise known for his conservative views especially on crime.
He has waged a much-criticised war on drug users and dealers leading to thousands of extra-judicial killings.
His latest remarks were made on Sunday night to Filipino expatriates in the Burmese capital of Nay Pyi Taw while on an official trip to Myanmar. A transcript of the speech was only given to journalists on Monday.
In a meandering speech addressing criticism of his now-suspended war on drugs, Mr Duterte accused the West of imposing its values on the Philippines, then referred to a recent Time magazine story on the transgender community in the US.
""There is no gender because you can be a he or she... That's their culture. It does not apply to us. We are Catholics and there is the Civil Code, which says that you can only marry a woman for me... a woman to marry a man.
""That's our law so why would you accept that gender?"" he said.
""Wherever God placed you, just remain there. Do not mix it upâ€¦ You erase the great divide between a woman and a man,"" he added.
Before becoming president in June 2016, Mr Duterte was the mayor of Davao city, which introduced anti-discrimination laws for sex, gender and sexual orientation during his administration.
In 2015, Mr Duterte appeared on a national talk show where he said same-sex marriage was ""good... everyone deserves to be happy"".
The following year, while campaigning for the presidency, he said he would ""consider"" legalising same-sex marriage if there was such a proposal.
The Philippines has 80 million Catholics and remains a deeply religious society.
Mr Duterte has taken issue with the church previously, once calling the Pope a ""son of a whore"".
Despite his many controversial comments he still remains highly popular in the Philippines. A summary is","Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has said he opposes gay marriage, after previously declaring he would consider legalising it.",None,generation

87,"Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool would have drawn level on points with leaders Manchester City with a fifth successive Premier League victory, but were subdued by a classic Jose Mourinho performance of defensive organisation and discipline.
United did not allow Liverpool to build the momentum and intensity that has characterised their game this season, while Mourinho's limited attacking ambitions ensured chances were at a premium.
The Portuguese was still grateful for two fine second-half saves from goalkeeper David de Gea, who dived low to stop Emre Can and saved athletically from Philippe Coutinho's 25-yard effort.
United's best chance also came in the second half, but the unmarked Zlatan Ibrahimovic directed Paul Pogba's cross off target.
The visitors had just 35% of possession - their lowest in a Premier League match since Opta began recording the data in 2003-04.

While this deadlock does little for the ambitions of both teams, there is no doubt who will be the happier manager.
This was, in so many respects, the most Mourinho performance of his short time at United.
Klopp came on to the pitch at the final whistle to applaud Liverpool's fans, but there was a tinge of disappointment in his measured tread as he trudged off.
His side's promising start to the season has been built on pressing opponents into submission - a high-pressure style that has brought victories at Arsenal and Chelsea, as well as nine goals in two home wins against Leicester City and Hull City.
But Mourinho picked a powerful, athletic side and instructed them to turn the tables on Liverpool's pressing game.
Ander Herrera was at the heart of United's smothering gameplan, almost operating in the pockets of Coutinho and Roberto Firmino in midfield, while Liverpool were never given a second.
They simply could not find a way through.
United held their shape and discipline, much to their manager's satisfaction, although he still needed those two superb saves from De Gea, and a magnificent saving tackle from Antonio Valencia to stop Firmino as he raced in on goal.
It was classic Mourinho, a tactic he has perfected and utilised throughout his career, and Anfield's increasing anger and frustration will have been music to his ears.
This match should have been the perfect stage for the £89m Pogba - but once again he was a peripheral figure.
The world's most expensive player was used in a more advanced role and is certainly on the same wavelength as Ibrahimovic, delivering a perfect cross which the Swede should have converted.
In other aspects, though, he operated on the margins of the game and failed to exert the influence expected of a player of his quality and experience.
United will expect much more as the season goes on.
Anthony Taylor was the man in the middle in every sense after the heat generated by the appointment of the Manchester-based official for a meeting between these two fierce rivals.
Mourinho said the appointment made it ""difficult"" for Taylor, and put him under pressure - comments being investigated by the Football Association - while former referee Keith Hackett even suggested it represented a risk to his and his family's safety.
It certainly increased the scrutiny on Taylor, who felt the wrath of The Kop within minutes - complete with colourful reminders about his place of residence - when he did not book Marcus Rashford for a foul on James Milner.
It was to the official's credit that he did not buckle in the atmosphere, kept discipline without resorting to a rash of yellow cards, and controlled a game that always has explosive potential.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: ""I am not frustrated but I am not happy with the performance. No-one will show this game in 10 or 20 years but we could have played better.
""It was a hectic game, interrupted here and there, but we lost patience with our passing game. The attitude of my team was really good. We were ready to fight but when you can play better, you have to.
""The kind of defence is difficult to play. The man-marking is really difficult, they are stronger than us. We wasted energy in the first half for nothing. The second half was better and with fresher legs in second half we could have created more.""
Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho: ""It is not the result we wanted but it is a positive result. It is a result that stops a direct opponent getting three points at home, so not a bad result.
""The game was difficult for both teams but for longer periods it was more difficult for them than us.
""We controlled the game not just tactically but the emotion of the game. That was probably the quietest Anfield I had and I was expecting it to be the other way.
""It was a positive performance.""

New standards were introduced by the Welsh government over a year ago aimed at ensuring equal access to healthcare.
But the report says little progress has been made.
Richard Williams, director of Action on Hearing Loss Cymru said the charities that authored the report are ""really concerned"" that people are leaving surgeries and hospitals unclear about what doctors have told them, what medication they need or whether operations have been successful.
New standards were brought in after a BBC Wales investigation in 2013 found health boards were breaching equality laws by not providing accessible services for the deaf and hard of hearing.
But 91 per cent of people surveyed for the report said they were not aware of improvements in the way healthcare providers communicate and share information with them.
Kay Coleman from Swansea began losing her hearing 15 years ago and said she finds it ""incredibly difficult"" to book a doctor's appointment.

90,"The 48-year-old man suffered a suspected heart attack five minutes into the second half of Kilmarnock's home match against Hibernian.
Paramedics and medical staff from both clubs treated the man until an ambulance arrived at Rugby Park stadium and he was taken to a nearby hospital.
Both managers agreed to abandon the match out of respect for the fan.
The stadium was hushed into silence when medical staff and club doctors attended the stricken fan in the west stand.
The referee then stopped the match with the teams drawing 1-1. Players left the pitch as the gravity of the situation became evident.
Kilmarnock chairman Michael Johnston said: ""The length of time the players were off the park was a problem but the overriding factor was respect for the fan and his family.
""He collapsed and was tended to by medical staff of both clubs and was taken to Crosshouse Hospital by ambulance.""
He added that he could not reveal any more information about the fan's identity other than to say he was a long-standing season-ticket holder

93,"Pensions currently rise by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.
There have been warnings over the cost of the lock, and the government says it will review it after 2020.
Shadow Treasury minister Rebecca Long-Bailey said this caused ""uncertainty and worry"", pledging to protect it ""throughout the lifetime of the next Parliament"", due to end in 2025.
Speaking during Treasury questions in the Commons, Chancellor Philip Hammond said it was responsible for the government to decide which commitments it can afford to keep at a spending review before the end of Parliament.
Attacking Labour's pledge, he added: ""I think it tells us everything we need to know about the Opposition - that three-and-a-half years out they're willing to spray around commitments without any idea of what it's going to cost them.""
During last week's Autumn Statement Mr Hammond said the triple lock would be maintained until 2020 but suggested it would then be reviewed.
There have been calls for it to be scrapped, including from former pensions minister Baroness Altmann, who said the costs would become ""enormous"" after 2020, and the previous work and pensions secretary, Stephen Crabb.
Speaking after Treasury Questions, shadow chancellor John McDonnell accused the Conservatives of ""abandoning older people"" by not guaranteeing to continue the pledge.
He added: ""Labour will support the pensions triple lock and instead of cutting taxes for the super-rich and giant corporations will make sure our NHS and social care is properly funded.""

94,"The proposals are the brain child of Swiss businessman turned politician Thomas Minder, who runs a small family company producing natural cosmetics.
Mr Minder wants shareholders to have a veto over managers' salaries, and to ban golden handshakes altogether.
The ""fat cat initiative"", as it has come to be called, would, if approved, be written into the Swiss constitution, and would apply to all Swiss companies listed on Switzerland's stock exchange.
Mr Minder, an outspoken man, says the culture of high salaries and high bonuses in Switzerland has got out of hand, pointing to the fact that huge sums have been paid out even when the companies concerned were doing badly.
The bankruptcy of national icon Swissair back in 2001, and the subsequent huge payoffs to its failed boss Mario Corti, were the catalyst to Mr Minder's decision to act.
""That really stuck in my throat,"" he told Swiss television. ""It made me absolutely furious.
""I'm still furious today, to think that a chief executive like Mr Corti could get five years' salary to go. I mean, the company was in a disastrous situation. At the end he wasn't even paying its bills. Swissair went bankrupt. The company doesn't exist anymore.""
Salaries for Swiss top managers are higher than most and their taxes are lower.
These two things alone would not necessarily anger most voters, however.
What has attracted support for Mr Minder's initiative has been a series of perceived disasters for major Swiss companies, coupled with salaries and bonuses staying high.
The main example is banking giant UBS, which wrote off billions in the wake of the 2007 sub-prime mortgage crisis, and then had to be bailed out by the Swiss government.
After that, the bank lost more billions because of a rogue trader, and announced thousands of redundancies.
But high salaries and bonuses for the bank's top managers continued throughout.
""The fat cats are getting fattest in the banks,"" says Edouard Dommen of the Swiss shareholders group Actares.
""The other companies are getting fat, but not quite so grossly.""
Mr Dommen, who supports the new measures, believes voters are especially angry about UBS, because their own tax money had to be spent to bail out the bank.
""People are fed up,"" he says. ""They know that this is at their expense.
""Small people had to dig into their own pockets to bail out these banks, and then see people, some of whom turned out to be literally crooks, walk off with their money, so of course they are angry.""
If passed, the measures would give Switzerland some of the strictest laws on executive pay in the world, far tougher than the limit on bonuses just approved by the European Union.
Both the Swiss government and Swiss business leaders have been campaigning against the measures.
The government says it understands that voters want some control over high salaries and has offered a milder alternative, but so far this seems to have attracted little interest.
Meanwhile the Swiss Business Association has been arguing that the measures would undermine Switzerland's ability to compete.
""Certainly, it will damage our competitiveness,"" says the association's deputy head of competition and regulation, Meinrad Vetter. ""We are against this initiative because it violates Switzerland as a business location.
""It's not good if the corporation law is too strict and too rigid in comparison to other countries, and with this initiative we will be an island in corporate governance all over the world.""
Business leaders have argued that some of Switzerland's biggest companies might simply leave, if they were unable to attract top quality managers because they were not allowed to pay them what they wanted.
For the pharmaceutical giant Novartis, such a move might actually be quite easy.
The company's current headquarters is in Basel, within sight of both the German and French borders.
Concerns over loss of competitiveness, and fears that Swiss companies might emigrate, did at first seem to be striking a chord with voters.
But one event, caused ironically by Novartis itself, seems to have changed a lot of minds.
In February of this year it was announced that Novartis' outgoing chairman Daniel Vasella would be receiving a 72m Swiss francs (Â£51m; $78m) ""non-compete"" pay off over six years, designed to stop him working for other related industries.
There was amazement and anger in Switzerland. Mr Vasella's salary had been regarded by many as excessively high for some time. Meanwhile, Novartis had been cutting jobs.
""I thought this was absolutely astonishing,"" says Mr Dommen, a man who doesn't mince his words.
""He is an idiot. I say he's an idiot because given this vote is coming up, to do something so grossly provocative at that moment just guaranteed that the opposition was going to win.""
The payment was scrapped in response to protests.
And indeed, the latest opinion polls seem to reflect that, showing that 64% of voters will say yes to the ""fat cat initiative"".
Mr Dommen does not believe a yes vote will isolate Switzerland.
Instead, he says, it would bring his country into line with public opinion across Europe.
""Times are changing throughout Europe,"" he says.
""The period when people could get away with these enormous salaries is going out of fashion.
""In Switzerland we are not on a different planet - it's going out of fashion here too. Most Swiss voters think something has to change.""
Opinion polls have been wrong in the past, of course, but all the signs are that on Sunday, Switzerland's fat cats will have to start tightening their belts.

Transgender people are discriminated against in Pakistan and struggle to find employment.
More than 45 transgender people have been killed in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the past two years, according to local rights group Trans Action.
Last month, a 23-year-old transgender activist died after delays in treatment. Alisha, who was shot eight times, was in critical condition when admitted to hospital but staff could not decide whether to put her in a male or female ward, according to her friends.
Trans Action, an advocacy group, say that there are at least 45,000 transgender people in the province and at least half-a-million nationwide.
In 2012, Pakistan's Supreme Court declared equal rights for transgender citizens, including the right to inherit property and assets. They were also given the right to vote the year before.

98,"Ildar Dadin is serving two and a half years for a series of street protests.
He told his lawyer that he had been strung up by his handcuffed wrists, had his head shoved down a toilet and been threatened with rape and death.
Russia's prison service says the claims are untrue but will investigate if the activist complains formally.
Unusually, the allegations made the headlines on state-controlled television on Tuesday after Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the case merited ""the closest attention"" and that President Vladimir Putin would be informed.
Dadin's supporters gathered outside the justice ministry on Tuesday evening in protest.
Ildar Dadin, 34, says his problems began after he was transferred to Prison Number Seven in the Karelia region of north-western Russia in mid-September and sent directly to a punishment cell.
More on this story:
Now out of isolation, Dadin has dictated a letter to his wife via his lawyer, in which he says he was beaten and kicked repeatedly by up to a dozen prison staff.

""They then took off my pants and said that they would bring in another prisoner who would rape me if I didn't agree to end my hunger strike,"" Ildar Dadin writes.
He had stopped eating in protest at being held in a punishment cell.

100,"Coatbridge College head John Doyle was given the money after his institution merged with two other colleges.
Holyrood's public audit committee, which said the principal was paid ""in excess of the guidelines"", has passed its report to Police Scotland.
Mr Doyle told MSPs in October he had done nothing wrong and that his reputation had been unfairly ""trashed"".
In June, the Auditor General Caroline Gardner issued a highly-critical report of the severance deals paid out by Coatbridge College, which she said were overly-generous.
She claimed Mr Doyle and chairman of the former college - John Gray - had colluded in order to ""achieve a certain outcome"" by withholding important information from the remuneration committee.
The report by the Scottish Parliament's audit committee agreed with the auditor general.
Mr Doyle, who earned £116,000 a year by the end of his service, was given:
Six other college staff also benefited from the £850,000 pot of pay-off money.
Police Scotland said that officers had had discussions with Audit Scotland and the ""matter is under review"".
Following the report, the Scottish government said it would ""carefully consider its [the report's] recommendations in the coming days"".
Committee convener Paul Martin said: ""There is a compelling moral argument for John Doyle to repay the tens of thousands of pounds extra he received from the college.
""The Scottish government provided more than £52m between 2011/12 and 2013/14 to support the college merger process and most of that money was used to fund voluntary severance schemes.
""It was not provided however to allow already highly-paid public servants to feather their own nests at the expense of their colleagues and of their students' education.""
The report made key recommendations, including;
A Scottish government spokeswoman said the way in which ""decisions involving hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money were made at Coatbridge College were completely unacceptable"".
She added: ""The events in question took place before April 2014 when colleges were reclassified by ONS and stronger financial controls came into effect.""
By Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland political correspondent
MSPs on Holyrood's public audit committee were unanimous.
Their report into bumper pay-offs for Coatbridge college bosses finds that the principal, John Doyle, was responsible for ""serious failings in the governance of severance arrangements"".
It says he colluded with the chairman, John Gray to secure ""excessive"" pay-offs for himself and six other senior managers by deliberately withholding information from those who signed off the deals.
The committee is urging Mr Doyle to pay back much of his £304,000 golden goodbye.
They say this request and their decision to copy their report to Police Scotland are without precedent.
Mr Doyle has previously refused to pay back any money arguing that he has ""done nothing wrong"". Mr Gray has also denied collusion.
The committee convenor, Paul Martin, says in these circumstances the charity regulator or the Scottish Funding Council should think creatively about how they could force a clawback.
The difficulty with these demands is that what MSPs find morally questionable may prove to be contractually correct. A summary is","A former college principal should hand back some of his £304,000 severance pay, a committee of MSPs has concluded.",None,generation

If the former Nottingham Forest and Derby County defender had access to the sort of help and support he is now eager to offer young footballers, he may well have achieved a great deal more.
Now retraining as a counsellor, Charles - still best remembered for his innocent part in the infamous tackle that almost ended Paul Gascoigne's career - is determined to give something back to the sport that gave him so much.
His journey has been far from smooth, with the low point a six-month prison sentence for dangerous driving and failing to give a breath sample that was brought about by his drinking.
Following his time in the East Midlands Charles, who won two England caps, was forced to retire at the age of 32 after injury-plagued spells with Aston Villa, Benfica and West Ham. It was the injuries that led to the boozing.
""While I was playing I was disciplined,"" Charles told BBC Inside Out. ""As soon as I was injured - if it was for any length of time - I would maybe go out a little bit more than I would normally. But it wouldn't be all the time.
""I am the first to admit that I have had my issues with drinking and I am a recovering alcoholic. But my drinking was very different from someone drinking every day. It wasn't all the time, it would be the odd time that would last two or three days.
""I wasn't a typical alcoholic. I could stop and go long periods of time without drinking.
""But toward the end of my football career it would last a little bit longer - definitely. As soon as I was nearly back to full fitness, I would go back in to my disciplined life again.""

Charles has been sober for nine years. The 45-year-old is director of football at Nottingham University and is working with Priority Health - a specialist organisation to help young footballers.
And he really wants to help.
""If a lot more people were more honest and there wasn't such a stigma around alcoholics or drug addicts then a lot of people would benefit from it,"" Charles said.
""We need to encourage young players not to live with addictions and talk to people.
""I know it is hard for a young player to go to a coach or an assistant manager and say 'listen I am struggling with drinking' or gambling or whatever because they do think it could be detrimental to their careers and maybe they will not get the contract of their dreams.
""There are things away from football clubs and there are people you can speak to.
""I want people to know that if you are struggling with addiction, speak to somebody about it because it does help. You don't have to go through hell when you can address your issues a lot earlier and go on and live a normal life.""
His time in prison was the real end of his ""normal life"" and helped set him on the way to sobriety. Charles was struggling to deal with the end of his career and it was at this point that he realised things needed to change.
""Prison was definitely something that opened my eyes to being somewhere I didn't want to continue going,"" Charles said.
""I just didn't want to drink any more or feel the way I was feeling any more. I had just had enough.
""Football is very much a closed shop but I think it is something that needs to be talked about. Addiction does not pick a certain type.""
Football life for London-born Charles began brilliantly as a youngster forcing his way in to Brian Clough's Forest side at the end of the 1980s.
""It's a big thing when you actually come in to a club and you are here every day and are watching the first team play,"" Charles said.
""The Forest team had a lot of great players at the time. I still remember cleaning the boots of Johnny Metgod, Garry Birtles, Gary Mills and Gary Fleming; they were the four players I looked after.
""That was one of the biggest things I enjoyed because I got to go in to the first team dressing room and listen to what they spoke about.""
Despite all Charles achieved, it was his part in the Gazza story that still triggers the memory banks when his name crops up.
Forest reached the 1991 FA Cup final where they played a Tottenham side featuring Gascoigne and Gary Lineker.
Despite going ahead through a trademark Stuart Pearce free-kick, Brian Clough's Forest lost a thrilling match 2-1.
But the game - enthralling as it was - was overshadowed by two moments of Gazza madness. His first challenge on Garry Parker saw Gascoigne plant his foot in the Forest midfielder's chest, the second saw the Lazio-bound superstar rupture a cruciate ligament in his right knee because of his ugly lunge on Charles.
""I remember the tackle on Parks,"" Charles said. ""I thought that was worse than my one to be honest. It was just a mis-timed tackle. It is something that every professional footballer has done.
""I didn't think much of it. I know a lot was made of it but I was more disappointed with us losing the game. If you speak to a lot of the Forest lads that is one of our biggest regrets. It was a massive day for the club.""
Charles wants to ensure the young footballers he comes into contact with will only have reason to regret matters on the pitch.

Newtownards Magistrates' court heard he allegedly confessed to his social worker that he got a dog which was ""free to a good home"" from a website.

104,"No firms in Northern Ireland have so far been affected by the ransomware attack, which wreaked havoc on organisations including the National Health Service in England and Scotland.
The virus could have spread even further had a cyber security researcher not accidently discovered a ""kill switch"" in the malicious program.
He was assisted by a researcher from security firm Proofpoint, which has an office in Belfast.
There is no shortage of cyber security experts in Northern Ireland - the industry now employs about 1,200 people.
And there is such a demand for their expertise, they can earn twice the average salary in Northern Ireland.
Invest NI - the region's business development agency - says Northern Ireland is the number one location in the world for cyber security inward investment and the number one global destination for US cyber security companies with an eye for international expansion.
Invest NI said companies had been enticed by the ""hard-to-find"" skillsets being nurtured at Queen's and Ulster University.
""Companies such as Black Duck, Rapid 7, Proofpoint, Alert Logic and Whitehat are recent investors here,"" said a spokeswoman.
""And with Symantec, a security software vendor, predicting the number of job openings to rise to 6m globally by 2019, there are real opportunities for our talented workforce.""
Emily McDaid writes about all things tech and edits the Techwatch blog for Catalyst Inc Connect, a not-for-profit network that runs a number of programmes to help innovation companies get off the ground or grow.
Northern Ireland has a booming tech sector, she said, particularly in the fields of cyber security, data analytics, fintech (software for the financial sector) and blockchain - the technology underpinning the digital currency Bitcoin.
""London is no longer the go-to place,"" she said. ""Northern Ireland is a cheaper place to live and do business. And if the corporation tax was to be lowered, that would be massive for the sector.""
Cyber security has become big business for corporate firms and start-ups in Northern Ireland, she said, and they are in the unique position of working in both the Irish and UK markets.
She has written about a start-up in Belfast, one of only two companies in the world, which uses a person's heartbeat as a way of identification, as opposed to fingerprints or retinal scan.
Then there are the two female cryptography experts looking at how to keep data safe when quantum computing becomes a reality - quantum computers will be so clever they will be able to break security algorithms easily, and hack data in seconds.
In addition to working with at least 500 entrepreneurs each year, Mrs McDaid's organisation inspires young people to pursue careers in tech and innovation.
""Cyber security is so big at the moment, it has an 0% unemployment rate,"" added Mrs McDaid.
""The more NI becomes a recognised centre of innovation, the more you will get the talent coming up through the generations.""
Last week, two international conferences were held in Belfast on the issue of cyber security - it is a burgeoning industry because with every technological advance comes a new opportunity for criminals to exploit it.
One of the conferences was hosted by the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT), based at the Northern Ireland Science Park in Belfast's Titanic Quarter.
CSIT, which is part of Queen's University Belfast, is home to the UK's largest cyber-security research cluster.
David Crozier, head of strategic partnerships and engagement at the major research hub, says it has a ""critical mass of researchers"" looking at malware, network security, encryption and critical infrastructure.
He said the centre had acted as a magnet for companies, attracted by the research and skilled workforce.
While it is a global export-based business, with most firms working for multi-nationals, the industry is a significant contributor to the economy, says Mr Crozier.
""The skills are so in demand at the moment that the industry is on course to generate salaries of £60m per annum,"" he said.
""For those citizens with the knowledge, they are able to earn about £42,500 per year - the average salary here is about £23,000.""
Northern Ireland as a whole also wins because it means some of the world's foremost cyber-security experts are living here.
""Citizens not working in the industry will benefit from the expertise and all the work that is going on to ensure government and public service systems are resilient and secure,"" said Mr Crozier.
""They can never be 100% secure and breaches are a daily occurrence, even for big companies, but more often than not, networks will be protected.""
Mr Crozier is part of a working group, which includes the police and various government departments.
Since last year, it has been operating as the NI Cyber Security Framework for Action and its aim is to ensure a co-ordinated approach to cyber security.
The group has formulated a set of priorities and while the political deadlock at Stormont means they are still unpublished, Mr Crozier says the work is certainly not on hold.
""The man on the street doesn't want to think about cyber security,"" he added.
""But the public needs to know there are people working behind the scenes to protect networks and keep ahead of attackers.
""They are unsung heroes and they only come to prominence when a major event happens."" A summary is",Cyber security has hit the headlines after an unprecedented cyber-attack brought down computer systems around the world on Friday.,None,generation
105,"Researchers said they found German coins minted during World War Two in the ruins in northern Argentina.
The researchers said that the buildings were probably never used by fugitive Nazis, because they found they could live freely in Argentine towns.
Nazis who fled to Argentina included Adolf Eichmann and Erich Priebke.
The researchers from the University of Buenos Aires said they decided to investigate the buildings because of a local legend claiming they had been used as a hide-out for Martin Bormann, a close aide to Adolf Hitler.
The overgrown ruins are located in Teyu Cuare park, near the town of San Ignacio in northern Misiones province.
Researcher Daniel Schavelzon told Argentina's Clarin newspaper that the architecture of the three buildings differed markedly from that of others in the region and that their purpose in the middle of a remote nature reserve was a mystery.
He said that a number of objects had been found that linked the buildings to wartime Germany, such as coins minted in the late 1930s and early 1940s and a fragment of Meissen porcelain made in Germany.
However, none of the objects has so far been found to have any direct links to any Nazi officers.
Mr Schavelzon told Clarin that his team thought previous theories, such as that the building had been built by Jesuit priests, were ""too simplistic"".
He also dismissed the local legend that Hitler's private secretary Martin Bormann had lived there.
Mr Schavelzon pointed to DNA tests carried out in 1998 on a skeleton found in Berlin that proved Bormann committed suicide in 1945 and did not flee to South America as had long been rumoured.
The researcher insisted, though, that the buildings in Teyu Cuare park were very unusual.
He said the walls, some of which were 3m (9ft) thick, were ""on an incredible scale"".
He also said that their location was ""completely inaccessible"".
""You'd never be able to find them if you didn't know their exact location,"" he said.
He said the theory the team was currently working on was that the buildings were constructed as a hide-out by the Nazis in case they lost World War Two.
But he said he did not think it was ever used, as the Nazis found they could live in relative comfort in Argentine cities rather than have to hide in a remote jungle fortress.
Hundreds of Nazis and fascists, some of them wanted war criminals, were allowed to enter Argentina by the president at the time, Juan Peron.
Adolf Eichmann, the SS officer who oversaw the logistics of the Holocaust, famously lived in a suburb of Buenos Aires for years before being captured by Israeli agents.
In 2000, then-president Fernando de la Rua apologised for Argentina's role in providing a refuge for Nazi war criminals after World War Two.

106,"Anti-smoking groups say that is too long to wait, but there have been protests by some restaurant owners, who say their business will suffer.
Austrians like order, or ""Ordnung"" as they say in German. It is hugely frowned upon for a pedestrian to cross the road on a red light. And the streets and underground network of Vienna are kept remarkably clean.
But smoky air in cafes and restaurants has been widely tolerated for years.
""Smoking is a sort of culture, especially in Austria,"" Margit Schwed told me as she sat in Cafe Ritter in Vienna, with its gilt chandeliers and marble table tops.
""In the typical Vienna Kaffeehaus you take your coffee and your cigarette. I think people like the flair in the coffee houses.""
Austria has one of the highest rates of smoking in Europe, particularly among young people: 33% of Austrians smoke regularly, according to a 2012 Eurobarometer study. Only Greeks, Bulgarians and Latvians smoke more.
A survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that 27% of Austrian 15-year-olds smoke at least once a week, more frequently than any other children in the OECD area.
Several years ago, when many countries had already banned smoking in bars and cafes, Austria first adopted the idea of introducing separate smoking and non-smoking areas.
Small restaurants could choose whether to go smoke-free or not.
Larger restaurants, like Cafe Ritter, were obliged to provide a separate smoking section, sealed off by glass partitions.
The law was heavily criticised by doctors and anti-smoking groups as half-hearted and badly enforced.
Earlier this year, after the death of a prominent anti-smoking journalist from lung cancer, Austria's coalition government of the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party announced plans to bring in a total ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars by 2018.
""We have finally arrived in Europe with anti-smoking protection,"" Health Minister Sabine Oberhauser said.
However there were protests from the far-right Freedom Party and from Austria's Chamber of Commerce.
The Chamber of Commerce opposes the ban, because it says restaurants and cafes invested around â‚¬100m ($109m; Â£714m) to install ventilation systems and glass partitions to accommodate the separate smoking areas.
The economy minister, Reinhold Mitterlehner, has said their interests will be taken into account.
At Cafe Ritter, one of the waiters, Michael Schneider, told me the smoking ban should be brought in as soon as possible.

107,"Will that promising full-back relish being thrown deeper into the public spotlight?
What if the £200m superstar doesn't settle in Paris?
These are the types of questions being asked by clubs as they consider investing eye-watering sums on new players.
An emerging field of analysts and experts believe they have the answers.
But how do they find them?
Ever sent a tweet you've come to regret?
Last season, Burnley striker Andre Gray apologised and asked ""for forgiveness"" after homophobic tweets he sent in 2012 were shared.
And, just last week, Chelsea forward Kenedy was sent home from their pre-season tour of China after being accused of xenophobia and racism. He apologised for the Instagram posts.
But what can a club learn from a player's social media presence?
Ben Wright is head of sport at communications agency Cicero, which produces reports on players for clients across the globe, including seven in the Premier League and two in Spain's La Liga.
He says: ""We look all the way through a player's online presence. By doing this you can get an idea of what kind of person they are and how their character has evolved over time.
""We analyse media coverage, social media, fans' forums, everything that is available online, across 13 languages, to build up a public picture of their life.
""Are they using social media late at night? Do they blur the boundaries of public and private? How have they changed over time as they have begun to earn more money?
""Are they posting the kind of insight into their private lives that fans really appreciate, or is it all about new cars and new clothes? And are they posting this kind of stuff regardless of whether it's been a good or bad result the weekend before?""
Some clubs have developed in-house teams - sometimes within their scouting departments - to perform similar research.
But in January, Cicero produced a report on a promising young Premier League player, who will remain anonymous.
The analysis uncovered a series of social media posts, dating back several years, that were sexually explicit in nature, and found angry responses to opposition fans that included offensive language.
Ultimately, the client who commissioned the report decided not to offer the player what would have been a significant development in his career.
Case study: Andrea Belotti
Torino striker Andrea Belotti has been linked with a move to the Premier League for much of the summer.
In July, Cicero was asked to produce a report on the £90m-rated Italian, and the findings were largely positive.
One section in the report - written for a Premier League club - analyses the ""tone and approach"" of his social media activity, while another addresses the '""likelihood of future issues"".
Belotti's posts, which featured regular tributes to his wife and family, displayed ""no instances of bad language, prejudice or public disagreements"", the report said.
""It is extremely unlikely he would ever post something or engage with fans on social media in a way that brings himself or his club into disrepute,"" it added.
But, in a section titled ""social media presence"", it says there would - at this stage - be a slim chance of a club harnessing his online following to counter-balance a hefty transfer fee.
Belotti's 30,000-plus followers were, the report said, heavily Turin-based; his appeal is markedly different to the global reach of, for example, Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba.
Perhaps that outweighed his good behaviour? Belotti, 23, remains in Serie A, where he scored 23 goals last season.

Is he worth 100m euros?
Despite the benefits to be gained from monitoring it, social media can give players an outlet to project themselves as something they are not.
That becomes harder when they cross the white line on match day.
Geir Jordet, professor in sport psychology at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, works with several top clubs across Europe - including in the UK.
""The best way to learn about about the psychology of a player is to observe what he does on the pitch,"" he says.
Jordet has devised a model of 11 attributes that can be used to judge whether a player will succeed, or can be helped to succeed, at the very highest levels.
Among the things he advises clubs to do are watch a player immediately after they make a mistake, see how they communicate with team-mates and assess to what extent the player is proactively involved in the game.
""I have built up a research portfolio on observing players' body language in matches, and I help clubs to see that,"" he says.
Jordet says clubs must also ensure any new player must fit in with the ""coaching culture"".
""The heavy training culture at one club, for example, might be a very powerful part of their recipe for success, and they might be especially keen to sign a player who fits into that - someone like Romelu Lukaku, for example.
""But there might be other clubs who would be willing to take more of a risk on a player who does not seem to be as dedicated, because they are good at dealing with so-called problem players, those who might be easily distracted by life off the pitch.""
To put it simply - everyone is different. Two individually brilliant footballers may not play well together.
Jesse de Preter, a director at Atticus Sports Management, says everyone involved in the talent-spotting process is thinking more than ever about the personality of players.
But he still regards it as an ""underdeveloped part"" of the business.
De Preter said: ""In the UK clubs it is a permanent search for talent, and many have specialists who are involved in the psychology of targets.
""The scouting departments, even at many of the Championship clubs, are full of people, full of TV screens, they have the most expensive software available, staff travelling constantly around the world. It is an extensive system, backed by a lot of money.
""Footballers are very highly paid employees, but for some reason we still think everyone should be treated in the same way. That is the same as saying: 'OK, it is physical training today, everyone runs five miles together.'
""You can see the proof every year. When a brilliant player goes for a lot of money somewhere, and does not do well, the player is blamed, the coach is blamed.
""Then, when the player goes away to another environment and becomes a star, everyone says 'oh it was too early for him', when there will be many other factors why it didn't work out, completely linked to his personality; the way he functions in a group, or the other people in a group.""
So where does this fit in with the traditional methods used by scouts?
Tor-Kristian Karlsen is now an 'independent advisor' to clubs but he used to work as a scout across Europe. He believes that the ""expertise of psychologists is a useful addition to the scouting process"".
However, he also makes the point that the traditional role of scout - if done well - has always involved ""studying players in a social context"".
This could include observing behaviour in training, a player's standing within the group dynamic in social situations, such as at a team hotel, or their reaction to the media.
He says: ""In our environment, you have seen so much of a player before you sign him - in training, in matches, interviews - and you have spoken to people that you trust, like previous coaches and other people in the football world. Usually the total of all that information is deemed to be sufficient to make a call on a player.
""If you look at a player like Kylian Mbappe, you know that he has come through the French elite national academy at Clairefontaine, then the Monaco academy, so already you know he has gone through an excellent school with really high standards. That would make you comfortable about signing him.
""Football always involves an element of risk. I don't think even the most skilled psychologist in the world could project with great accuracy where a player is going to end up. But of course it makes sense to involve such professionals, and there are clues to be found in his behaviour on the pitch, in his reputation, in his development.""
De Preter describes the increasing focus on personality as a ""new trend"".
And while former Tottenham and Liverpool director Damien Comolli says clubs have ""always checked players' backgrounds extensively"" he acknowledges the game is changing.
He says people are beginning to ""look more at the individual as a human being before as a football player"", a trend he describes as ""one of the main current topics in recruitment"".
""High-level sport is so demanding,"" he adds. ""If we get the wrong individual in on day one, that can destroy everything the club is trying to achieve.
""When I was at Tottenham we were thinking about a massive investment on a striker who was playing abroad. I travelled to meet him, and in our conversation I asked him why he would like to join Tottenham.
""His reply was: 'Well, I would like to live in London, because there I can have a quiet life with my girlfriend without everyone recognising me in the street.'
""I left that meeting feeling very uncomfortable. He never told me he wanted to win, he never told me he wanted to help the club or help himself improve.
""This is what clubs are trying to understand before they sign players, and now I think everyone is pretty much talking about the same thing: getting the right person in as well as the right player.
""It is a trend that is not going to stop evolving, and we are only at the beginning."" A summary is","Will a £300,000-a-week salary change a hot prospect's attitude to the game?",None,generation

Hearts went ahead when Alexandros Tziolis' shot took a deflection off Keith Lasley and looped over goalkeeper Craig Samson.

Goncalves had an early low shot just wide before Louis Moult's header hit the bar, but the flag was up - wrongly - for offside against the Motherwell striker.
The hosts had started the match with a back three in an attempt to stymie the Hearts attack, but as the half wore on the away side became more dangerous.
First, a great run from left-back Lennard Sowah forced a save from Samson.

Then Jamie Walker threatened with a couple of fierce efforts which were just off target. He perhaps should have had a penalty when it looked like he had his shirt pulled in the box.
Malaury Martin then stung the palms of Samson with a free-kick from 25 yards, but Motherwell would finish the half strongly.
From a corner Lionel Ainsworth fired in a shot which was cleared off the line by Anastasios Avlonitis. McHugh then fired an effort over the bar.
Moult was wrongly awarded awarded a free-kick at the edge of the box, having actually been tripped by team-mate Ainsworth. Referee Andrew Dallas even mistakenly booked Hearts midfielder Martin.
Moult took the free-kick himself and the ball flew narrowly wide of Jack Hamilton's goal.
Red cards defined Motherwell's match with Rangers last weekend and another sending off played a massive part in this match.
This time it was McHugh who lunged in, catching Cowie painfully. There were echoes of Scott McDonald's red card tackle on Rangers' Kenny Miller, and it looked like the right decision by Dallas.
Just minutes later Hearts opened the scoring. The impressive Greece international midfielder Tziolis fired in a shot from 20 yards which took a massive deflection off Lasley and beat Samson.
But Lasley almost levelled moments later, his effort narrowly off target.
Goncalves has shed 8kg and with his improved conditioning and professionalism it's intriguing to ponder what he can do for this Hearts side.
The management at the club clearly believe in the talents of this mercurial player, and that belief will give Goncalves added confidence.
He looked determined to get his first Hearts goal and caused Motherwell problems all afternoon.
It finally came as he fired home with a composed finish. It clearly meant a lot to him as he celebrated with the travelling fans - for which he was duly booked.
Goncalves restrained himself from a second yellow after he scored again as Hearts made it two wins in four days following Wednesday's 4-1 defeat of Rangers.

A man aged 25, of Borehamwood, had been bailed until September, said police.
They said they would contact families directly should they discover that any children had been affected.
A spokesman for Ofsted said: ""We can confirm we have suspended the registrations of these early years settings while investigations are carried out.
""It would be inappropriate to comment further while investigations are ongoing.""
In a joint statement, Hertfordshire Police and Hertfordshire County Council said they were working with Ofsted and the ""safety and welfare of children is the top priority"".
Anyone with specific concerns about a child is asked to call Hertfordshire County Council on 0300 123 4043.
A statement from the LL Camps team was posted its Facebook page on Thursday. It said the camp had closed with ""immediate effect"" and it ""cannot disclose any further information"".
The privately-run LL Camps is based at St Margaret's School in Bushey.
A school spokeswoman said LL Camps was ""entirely non-related to our school"" and St Margaret's had ""no links to LL Camps except to hire out a part of the Sports Centre site during the holiday periods"".
The LL Camps website, which has been taken offline, stated it had achieved ""outstanding early years provider"" awards from Ofsted in 2013 and 2014.
It said the camp was about ""meeting new friends, expanding interests and learning new skills"". It added it was committed to its core values of creating a ""caring, nurturing and positive"" environment.

A winner must be declared on the night - as an ice hockey rink needs to be laid at midnight for a match at the same Hallenstadion venue the following day.
But what else do you need to know?
BBC Radio 5 live's sports news correspondent Richard Conway explains.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Fifa's 209 nations will gather in Zurich for what is billed as an ""extraordinary congress"".
It was called after Sepp Blatter dramatically announced last June that he would step aside after 18 years as Fifa president.
The 79-year-old Swiss said he was ""laying down his mandate"", which has led to some concern he may not have actually resigned.
However, Fifa officials are confident he will not make an awkward re-appearance - not least because he has been banned from football for eight years over a ""disloyal payment"" of £1.3m to suspended Uefa president Michel Platini.
Both men deny wrongdoing and are appealing against their bans.
Blatter also has no accreditation to get into the conference hall on the outskirts of Zurich where the congress is being held.
There are two big issues to settle.
First, the FA representatives have to agree to a package of reforms designed to eliminate the problems that have plunged Fifa into crisis in recent months and restore its reputation.
Then, if and when that is formalised, they have to appoint a new president.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Given the hype and spin around the election the reforms have been slightly forgotten about - but they are vitally important to the organisation's future.
One Fifa insider believes it would be a ""disaster"" if measures to clean up the governing body fail.
Specifically, Fifa wants members to agree to term limits for top officials along with disclosure of their salaries.
Responsibility for everyday business decisions will be removed from the ""political"" representatives of national associations.
The ""executive committee"" will be disbanded. In its place will come a new 36-member Fifa council, which will include a minimum of six women, to set global strategy.
The day-to-day running of Fifa will pass to a new ""general secretariat"" - equivalent to a corporate executive board - and the secretary general, effectively the CEO, will be a powerful position.
The checks and balances will be carried out by a series of committees, the most important of which will be the fully independent audit and compliance committee.
Fifa wants the regional confederations and national associations to mirror their efforts over time and they will place immediate new demands on them, such as annual audits.
Media playback is not supported on this device
You would think so given Fifa's recent history. However, officials aren't taking any chances.
The proposals need 75% approval to be passed.
Acting president Issa Hayatou has been very active in spreading the message about the need to adopt the raft of proposals.
Hayatou was censured by the International Olympic Committee for his part in the ISL scandal - where the sports marketing company paid $100m (£66.2m) to officials, including former Fifa president Joao Havelange and ex-Fifa executive Ricardo Teixeira, in return for lucrative television and marketing rights throughout the 1990s.
Additionally, he has been accused of taking a $1.5m (£1.1m) bribe from Qatar to vote in favour of their bid to host the 2022 World Cup. Both he and Qatar categorically deny any wrongdoing.
So it is of interest that Hayatou has been at the forefront of the reform efforts.
Hayatou has an unassailable reputation (although not in Europe) amongst large sections of the 209 Fifa nations, despite his alleged wrongdoing. His voice carries weight amongst the ""family"" and the vote should therefore be carried without any issues.
Fifa is still in a perilous position with ongoing American and Swiss investigations into the activities of current and former officials.
As it stands, the organisation is considered a ""victim"" by the US Department of Justice. But that could change.
If the DoJ believes Fifa is not reforming or is carrying on as usual then it could be charged under US racketeering laws designed initially to tackle organised crime.
Passing the reforms are therefore vital if Fifa is to continue operating and not be shut down.
Yes. This is where it gets complicated.
The DoJ and the Swiss authorities are very interested in how the Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 World Cups were awarded and if any wrongdoing took place.
If Fifa were to be shut down it could render the contracts for both those tournaments null and void.
Geopolitically that could cause huge friction, especially given the delicate military situation in Syria at the moment.
In addition, the US is a big ally of Qatar and has a strategic air base there.
Given all of this, many question whether there is the political will from President Barack Obama's administration to carry out the ultimate threat. One insider said recently he believes there is pressure on Loretta Lynch, the US Attorney General, not to act in this regard.
Far from it.
In December, when the US made its second wave of arrests, it issued a superseding indictment.
There are 24 unnamed co-conspirators within the document, including high ranking Fifa officials and members of national FAs. Some may be cooperating with the US already, others not.
At some stage the US will have to act and a grand jury has been sitting in the US to consider ongoing matters.
In addition, the Swiss investigation into the 2018 and 2022 bidding process is ongoing. That enquiry has widened and has resulted in Blatter being criminally investigated.
Big question. No one knows right now.
If they do take action, the effect that has on the election will depend largely on who is targeted and where. The US is believed to be diverting its attention away from America and more towards Europe, Asia and Africa.
It is hard to see the mechanism by which the election could be stopped - but this is Fifa, so let's not rule anything in or out just yet.
Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain is still the front runner according to many observers.
He has the backing of his own Asian confederation and Africa, though the continents do not vote as a bloc and the ballot is held in secret.
However, such political backing from two of the biggest confederations should not be underestimated.
The national associations do not want to back the loser either… even though the vote is secret. There may be big swings in the vote between the rounds.

What about GianniInfantino?
Media playback is not supported on this device
The Uefa general secretary Infantino has, according to the 45-year-old Swiss' camp, made gains in recent weeks. They believe he is the man to beat.
Well, yes… but this is the same PR team behind Prince Ali bin al-Hussein's failed election attempt last May.
Back then they made very different noises in the build-up, briefing that 40-year-old Jordanian Prince Ali was unlikely to win but would give Blatter a bloody nose.
So their bullish confidence with Infantino should not be underestimated.
Infantino has strong support in Europe, South America and significant backing in the potentially crucial Caribbean.
They also think they will get half the votes in Africa. If that proves true then it's game over. He wins. ""If"" is the key word though.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Prince Ali lost the support of Europe for this election when Platini announced he was standing.
He failed to make gains after the 60-year-old former France captain was banned and Infantino stepped into his shoes.
A safe prediction for Prince Ali would be that he has between 20 and 30 pledges of support.
That means he simply cannot win - but he could be a significant player in deciding the eventual victor if he drops out and asks his supporters to back a rival candidate.
Frenchman Jerome Champagne will stay on to the bitter end but is highly unlikely to get more than 10 votes.
South African businessman Tokyo Sexwale's efforts have been something of a mystery and he has been criticised for running a lacklustre campaign.
He went on a joint visit to Robben Island, where he was a political prisoner, with Infantino on Monday.
Despite that he says he will not quit. He seems to be playing a longer game - perhaps with his eye on a new Fifa if the current organisation is ever abolished.
There are 207 eligible voters, with Kuwait and Indonesia currently barred from taking part.
That may change on Friday and the total number of voters will be announced before the ballot.
In the first round, the winner needs two-thirds of the available votes. If no candidate achieves that then a simple majority (105 in a 209-nation contest) is all that is required to win.
If there is still no winner then a third round will take place and the candidate with the fewest votes in round two would drop out at this point.
The candidates will each have 15 minutes to address Friday's congress, which is due to start at about 12:00 GMT.
In theory, the first round of voting should start at approximately 13:30 GMT.
Fifa estimates each round of voting will take one hour and 40 minutes. A safer bet is two hours, judging by previous elections.
So the earliest a winner is likely to be declared is about 17:30 GMT… let's see. A summary is",Football's crisis-hit world governing body Fifa will meet in Zurich on Friday and elect a new leader to try to take the damaged organisation forward into a new era.,None,generation

114,"Fees in England are rising again, and it is the first fall in UK applications since fees were last increased in 2012.
The Royal College of Nursing blamed the 23% drop in nursing applications on the removal of bursaries.
Universities Minister Jo Johnson said that despite the overall drop, more 18-year-olds were applying to university.
These Ucas admissions figures, up to the January deadline for courses starting in the autumn, show a 5% drop in UK students and 7% drop in students from the European Union - with a total of about 564,000.
Universities have been warning about the impact of Brexit on their finances if European applications fall and these figures show a significant decline in candidates from the EU.
There has also been a decline in UK students applying - and like the two previous occasions when applications have fallen - this has been when fees are being increased.
The fall in applications in England of 6% has been three times greater than in Scotland at 2%, which remains without tuition fees.
Applications from Wales fell most, by 7%, and Northern Ireland by 5%.
Nursing had the biggest fall of any individual subject, and Janet Davies, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, blamed this on the switch from grants to fees and loans.
""We warned the government the removal of student funding would see a sharp drop in nursing applications. These figures confirm our worst fears,"" said Ms Davies.
She said the ""nursing workforce is in crisis"".
But there were drops across other subjects - particularly among older students not applying directly from school.
Among 19-year-olds, numbers were down 9%. And among 25-year-olds, applications were down 23%.
But among 18-year-olds, such as sixth-formers applying from school, numbers have continued to rise to record levels, up to 37% of the age group.
And there could be an upside for those who are seeking places - with universities likely to be competing to attract students.
Ucas chief Mary Curnock Cook said this ""tough recruitment environment for universities"" would mean ""unprecedented choice and opportunity for applicants"".
Sorana Vieru, vice-president of the National Union of Students, said the fall in applicants was ""disappointing, but not a surprise"".
""Uncertainty around increases in tuition fees, loss of maintenance grants and the rising costs of living and studying at university are too much of a risk to some potential students,"" she said.
Labour's shadow universities minister, Gordon Marsden, said: ""We warned the government at Christmas their sneaked-out tuition fee increases and the accompanying increased debts would have damaging impacts on students and their numbers.""
Universities Minister Jo Johnson said: ""More young people than ever are choosing to go to university, with record application rates for 18-year-olds this year as well as those from disadvantaged backgrounds."" A summary is",University applications have fallen by 5% - with the decline driven by a drop in European Union students and a sharp fall in nursing applications.,None,generation
115,"There are concerns about the number of deaths at the hospital, which is at the centre of a long dispute over the future of children's heart services.
The medical director of the NHS, Bruce Keogh, said it was ""a highly responsible precautionary step"".
But some people have questioned the decision and its timing, 24 hours after a High Court ruling kept surgery there.
Leeds General Infirmary had been earmarked for closure by the NHS review to concentrate children's heart surgery in fewer bigger centres.
But that decision was quashed by a High Court judge on Wednesday.
Stuart Andrew, Conservative MP for Pudsey, who has led a cross-party campaign to keep the unit open, said it was a ""very odd"" decision coming after the jubilation that greeted the court ruling.
""We have always asked them 'is it safe at Leeds?' and the answer always came back 'yes it is'.
""What is the information that says that has changed?""
Congenital heart defects explained
He added he had not received one complaint about care.
Children who would have been treated in Leeds will be sent to other hospitals around England.
Affected families are being contacted directly by the trust and the review is expected to take three weeks.
Anne Keatley-Clarke, chief executive of the Children's Heart Federation, an umbrella group for different voluntary organisations, said she had raised concerns about surgery outcomes two years ago, and more recently parents had reported difficulties in getting referrals at Leeds to other heart units.
In a statement on the federation website, she said: ""My concern is that it appears that managers and clinicians in  Leeds, together with the parent support group, have put their own interests ahead of the well-being of critically ill children and their very vulnerable parents.""
Sir Bruce and senior managers from the Care Quality Commission visited the hospital on Thursday to say it must stop all children's heart surgery there immediately.
In a statement, Sir Bruce said: ""The trust has taken a highly responsible precautionary step.
""Some questions have been raised by the trust's own mortality data and by other information.
""It is important to understand that while this information raises questions, it does not give us answers.""
The chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said outside experts would be drafted in to help review ""all aspects"" of care.
In a statement, Maggie Boyle apologised to parents and families affected but assured them the trust always put the safety of patients first.
The CQC said it supported the trust's decision and it was in close contact with the trust to ensure effective arrangements were in place to protect the safety and welfare of patients.
Sharon Cheng, from Save Our Surgery - the group which is co-ordinating the fight to keep children's heart surgery in Leeds - said: ""We're mystified.
""We don't know of anything that could justify this step.""
Previously, an NHS review said surgery should stop at hospitals in Leeds, Leicester and London to focus care at fewer, larger sites, where medical expertise can be concentrated.
More than 600,000 people signed a petition opposing the closure plans. Many people were unhappy that children from Leeds faced journeys of up to 150 miles for care.

They were introduced in response to calls for a stronger voice for English MPs following increased devolution to Scotland.
Where parts of a bill are deemed to only affect England, or England and Wales, a new stage is added to the usual law-making process at which only MPs for English - or English and Welsh - constituencies can vote.

Local government minister Andrew Percy, revealed in a written statement that £15m EU Solidarity Funding received in respect of the winter 2015-16 floods would be ""offset"" by the £14.5m repayment.
The UK was ""legally obliged"" to make the repayment because there had been ""ineligible spending under the Labour administration"" of 2007 funding.
The remaining £500,000 was ""only eligible to reimburse"" the government for financial support given to affected areas, he said.
Westmorland and Lonsdale MP Mr Farron said the two parties had ""combined to deprive flood-hit areas of much needed funds"".
""Labour's overspending has hurt the North and all those affected by last year's floods,"" he said.
""But it is the Conservative's mean-spiritedness which means they have chosen to use this money to pay the fine, instead of passing this money on to flood-affected areas and paying the fine from Treasury coffers.""

The figures emerged after the court examined the latest stage of the dispute, for charges over three seasons between 2009 and 2012.
The force said it would now work with the club to agree what money, ""if anything"", remains outstanding.
Two years ago, the High Court ruled the force overcharged for ""special police services"" between 2009 and 2012.
Leeds United had argued policing streets and car parks near its Elland Road ground was the force's responsibility and the club should not have to pay.
The High Court ruled in the club's favour and West Yorkshire Police lost a subsequent appeal against the decision.

""We are opening a new window on the Universe and looking forward to seeing what's there,"" he said.
""As much as we have a lot of theories of what might be out there we don't know. We'd love to find something completely unexpected and we might, and that's the exciting bit.""
They want a glimpse into a world never seen before. By smashing atoms harder than they have been smashed before physicists hope to peel back another veil of reality.
The aim of the various theories of physics is to explain how the Universe was formed and how the bits that make it up work.
One of the most successful of these theories is called the ""Standard Model"".
It explains how the world of the very, very small works.
Just as the world became very strange when Alice shrunk after drinking a potion in the children's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, physicists have found things are quite different when they study the goings on at scales that are even smaller than the size of an atom.
By doubling the energy of the LHC, it will enable them to discover new characters in the wonderful and mysterious tale of how the Universe works and came to be.
The Standard Model describes how the basic building blocks that make up atoms and the forces of nature interact.
And just as in Alice's stories it features some eccentric characters, notably a family of 17 elementary particles.
Some are familiar from school physics lessons, household names if you like.
One of the best known in the sub-atomic world is perhaps the electron, which orbits the atom and is involved in electricity and magnetism.
Another flashy A-lister is the photon, which is a particle of light.
But most particles from the Standard Model family are more niche, a little more art house if you like, and have strange names.
In fact, one of them is actually called ""the strange quark"".
And others from this group of particles are named as if by thoughtless and unimaginative parents: ""up"", ""down"", ""top"" and ""bottom"" though ""charm"" does sound a little more, well, charming.
A couple of these combine in various ways to form protons and neutrons, which along with electrons make up atoms from which the world is made. These are all members of a group called ""fermions"".
And there is another group called the ""bosons"", that quite literally hold the place together.
They are called the ""force carriers"" in physics text books and give rise to the forces of nature: electrical, magnetic and nuclear forces, which pull other particles together or push them apart.
With the discovery of the sub-atomic world's biggest celeb of all, the Higgs boson, scientists have now detected all the particles predicted by the Standard Model: a theory that beautifully explains how the Universe works in intricate detail.
Or so scientists thought.
It is incomplete. For a long time physicists thought that their Standard Model theory could explain almost everything.
Then came two phenomena that showed that it explained hardly anything.
First was the observation that galaxies are rotating much more quickly than they should.
The faster a galaxy rotates the more material it contains.
The observations suggested that they contain five times more material than could be detected.
This invisible material has been called ""dark matter"" which physicists believe accounts for a quarter of the Universe.
Second was the observation that galaxies were accelerating apart from each other driven by an even more mysterious force that the researchers who discovered it called ""dark energy"".
So all in all the Standard Model, brilliant though it is at explaining how our tiny corner of the cosmos works can't account for how the remaining 95% of the Universe works.
Even then, of the 5% it is good for it can't explain gravity.
And, just as the erstwhile poster child of physics slinks off to find a place to curl up and quietly weep, comes the biggest humiliation of all: it can't explain why the Universe exists at all.
Shortly after the Big Bang there were equal amounts of matter, from which all the atoms, stars and planets are made and anti-matter.
Moments later the two should have cancelled each other out, as ripples sometimes do when meeting in a pond, to create a gigantic blast of energy and then, nothing but light.
Our very existence demonstrates that clearly this did not happen.
You might have thought that this was bad news for physics - but actually physicists such as Prof Nash couldn't be more excited.
""It's our biggest opportunity in a generation to find out what's the next step, where do we go from here and how do we explain the things we don't understand about the composition of the Universe.""
That is what physicists are hoping for. With the Large Hadron Collider set to double its energy, physicists hope that they will discovery weirder and even more wonderful particles that will point the way to a new more complete theory of sub-atomic physics.
In other words a sequel, with new even more bizarre characters and with no doubt some twists and turns in the plot.
Book two has the working title of: ""Beyond the Standard Model"".
Scientists hope to find evidence of the invisible ""stuff"" called dark matter: the unseen Cheshire Cat behind the grin of the visible Universe we see around us.
There are lots of different theories for what the cat might look like.
Among them is an idea called supersymmetry or ""Susy"" for short.
This idea predicts new particles that are invisible partners of the ones we know already about.
One of these could be dark matter.
Another idea is that dark matter could be explained by the wonderfully evocatively named ""dark sector"".
This comprises shadowy new particles that don't obey the same forces as everything else but cannot easily be detected. They might be the invisible culprits that have been making our galaxies rotate faster than they should.
Researchers will also be looking to find particles that are manifestations of extra-dimensions that we cannot detect but are predicted in some theories that extend the Standard Model to incorporate gravity.
And the LHCb experiment will be studying the differences between matter and anti-matter in unprecedented detail.
Who knows, but possibly one of the biggest changes in thinking in physics for 100 years.
Researchers, such as Prof Tara Shears of Liverpool University who is working on the LHCb experiment hope to have their first taste of so-called ""new physics: a set of discoveries that will radically transform the theories of physics and our knowledge of how the Universe works.
""If I could have just one outcome form the next run of the LHC this would be it,"" she explained with a far away look in her eyes.
""It would be to make a discovery so unexpected that it doesn't fit with any of our theories, something that would show us that we have been on the wrong track in our efforts to understand the way that the forces of nature work, the way that matter is composed, something that will knock our heads sideways to make us come from a new direction.
""And that would be the paradigm shift and that shift, in my dreams would lead us to a much deeper understanding of the Universe.
""It would be wonderful if we could make a head start that would point us in the right direction.""
The sub-atomic world is set to become ""curiouser and curiouser"".

Police justified the decision saying it was operating under a false licence.
The closure comes amid concerns amongst hardliners about growing Western influence in Iran as relations with a number of countries improve.
""The shutting down of Halal KFC was due to a misunderstanding,"" Abbas Pazuki, the manager of Halal KFC, told the Tasnim News Agency.
He said police had thought the restaurant was a branch of the American KFC.
""We are part of a brand known as Halal KFC, which comes from Turkey. It belongs to Muslims and its target market is Muslim nations,"" said Pazuki.
He said the Turkish brand was a ""rival of the American KFC"".
Earlier reports suggested the authorities closed down the first branch in Tehran of the better known KFC.
Ali Fazeli, head of the Iranian chamber of commerce, confirmed that the Iranian KFC has no connection with KFC in the US, according to ILNA press agency.
""In accordance with orders from the Supreme Leader, we do not give any authorisation to Western brands"" in the fast food sector, Fazeli said.
The state media reported the opening of the restaurant as a first sign of creeping US influence, the BBC's Kasra Naji says.

129,"This time last year rugby club Wasps was putting the final touches to its move from High Wycombe to Coventry, a 75 mile journey it hoped would transform it from a club losing more than £3m a year into a thriving leisure business.
As part of its relocation Wasps did not just move into, but acquired, the Ricoh Arena stadium complex in the West Midlands city for £20m.
The fact that the Barbadian artist - famous for hit singles like Umbrella, We Found Love, and Diamonds - is kicking off her high-profile tour in their stadium is a source of pride to club executives, and an indication of how far financially as well as geographically they have come.
It also illustrates how the Premiership club sees its new commercial model as being as much about leisure as it is about sport.
""The entertainment side is where we see the biggest commercial growth,"" Wasps Group chief executive David Armstrong tells me.
It was 13 months ago that Wasps, then based in Buckinghamshire, announced they would play their home games at the Ricoh Arena, completing the stadium purchase a month later. Their first game as owners of their new home was a win against London Irish in December 2014.
A year on, the club is no longer the tenant of Wycombe Wanderers football club, but a multi-venue, multi-use business.
Moving a major sporting ""franchise"" lock, stock and barrel from one city to another is not uncommon in the United States, but in the more conservative UK, such uprooting is greeted with suspicion.
""The primary reason for moving was commercial,"" Mr Armstrong said, speaking to the BBC at the annual Rugby Expo conference at Twickenham.
""We were looking to create a stable long-term business model that would take us forward over the next 250 years,"" he adds, referring to the length of their Ricoh lease.
""With our previous business model, we were losing in the region of £3m to £4m a year. Our only revenue then was ticket sales. Food and beverage sales went to the football club, while other revenue went to our sponsors.
""We were a shell of a club, and couldn't be competitive and make money.""
As well as its new income strands, earlier this year, the club raised £35m with the issue of a seven-year bond, paying a fixed gross rate of interest of 6.50% a year until 2022 . Funds raised were used to restructure the club balance sheet and pay down existing debt, including loans acquired with the Ricoh Arena.
According to Mr Armstrong the banks backed the bond issue because of the strength of the club's various income strands.
Ownership of the Ricoh Stadium complex gives Wasps control over other income streams, not just from rugby matches.
As well as the main sports stadium bowl, the purchase also saw the club acquire the indoor 12,000-standing-capacity Jaguar Exhibition Hall, which hosts smaller music concerts, and can also be hired for trade shows, company presentations and other business use.
And the Ricoh also contains three restaurants, five bars, 20 retail units, one of the biggest casinos in England, and a 121 bed hotel. Meanwhile, football club Coventry City football club, currently top of League One, are paying tenants.
""We are now a full end-to-end leisure brand, hosting conferences, banqueting, concerts, but headed by the rugby club,"" says Mr Armstrong.
""The important thing is that the other income strands give financial stability to the rugby team, they wrap around it.""
He said that before the club moved it carried out thorough research, which showed an appetite within the West Midlands region, home to about five million people, for top-flight rugby .
""So we knew there was a potential fan base before we arrived in the area,"" Mr Armstrong says. ""The West Midlands, although it has a strong rugby union heritage, has never had a Premiership club.""
He adds: ""In addition, we were looking at what we thought was the ultimate stadium for rugby union.
""It is not too big, not Manchester United-sized.  It is a 32,000 capacity, where crowds of 19,000 and 20,000 look comfortable. And it is also the right size for us to grow into as we extend our fan base.""
And the club, which currently sits eighth in the Premiership table after four games, has further expansion plans.
Schemes in the pipeline include building a new training centre in the next year or two in the Coventry area, a second or even third hotel at the Ricoh complex, and a new 150,000 sq ft ""multi-use leisure facility with retail, and food and beverage"".
There are also plans for an expanded Wasps rugby retail business in the West Midlands.
Meanwhile, the club says it also wants to provide a ""compelling digital offer"" not only for its rugby fans at the stadium (such as ordering food and drinks from your seat), but also for its other business customers who use the Ricoh facilities.
""But we never lose sight of what we are,"" he adds. ""We are a leading Premiership rugby club, and that will always be the heart of what do.
""The revenue we make means we can invest in training centres, coaches, physios, players and salaries, to give ourselves the best possible chance on the pitch.""
Dominic Hayes, commercial director of Premiership Rugby observes:  ""I think the work that Wasps have done to up sticks and move city is a testament to the strength of the Wasps brand.  We have got to acknowledge there is some real strength there.
""Similarly with the Wasps bond, that was on the strength of the Wasps brand, not the Ricoh.""
And, while other famous music acts have played in the main Ricoh Arena bowl in the past before Wasps took over, Mr Armstrong is particularly pleased at the Rihanna news.
""For us it is important to get these big names... and it's nice to give a poke in the eye to Birmingham,"" he laughs. A summary is","When pop superstar Rihanna last week unveiled her 2016 UK concert tour dates, her choice of opening venue was seen as a vindication for an English rugby union club that has financially come back from the brink.",None,generation
130,"In the programme, a man who said he too was a former IRA and Sinn Féin member turned British agent, alleged that the Sinn Féin leader approved the killing of Denis Donaldson in 2006.
The former spy cannot be identified because of fears about his safety.
Mr Donaldson was shot dead months after admitting that he had been an MI5 agent for more than 20 years.
Three years later, the Real IRA said it was responsible.
On Wednesday, Mr Adams said he ""specifically and categorically"" denied the allegations, describing them as ""part of the British security agencies ongoing attempts to smear republicans and cover up their own actions"".
He said he would consider taking legal action against the BBC.
""I've taken a number of cases against various periodicals, I got a number of corrections and apologies from a number of outlets,"" said Mr Adams.
""If my legal advisers give me the type of guidance that I require, I will sue them. I'm not reluctant to sue.
""That the BBC would broadcast unsubstantiated allegations from an anonymous person, a self-confessed agent, about me, I think it's very, very low journalism indeed.""
Mr Adams said there was a need for all agencies to ""fully co-operate with the ombudsman's investigation into the role of the police in the events that led to the killing of Denis Donaldson and for the Gardaí to expedite their investigation to bring those responsible to justice.""
The Sinn Féin leader said he would ""continue to support the family of Mr Donaldson to achieve truth and justice"".
Mr Donaldson had worked for Sinn Féin as a senior administrator at Stormont. He was killed at a remote Donegal cottage in 2006.

Agent: I know from my experience in the IRA that murders have to be approved by the leadership. They have to be given approval by the leadership of the IRA and the military leadership of the IRA.
Presenter: Who are you specifically referring to?
Agent: Gerry Adams, he gives the final say.
The informer told Spotlight that murders had to be approved by the political and military leadership of the IRA.

The confirmation about Laachraoui's role as an IS prison guard in Syria came from lawyer Marie-Laure Ingouf.
Laachraoui was a 24-year-old Belgian electrical engineer from the Brussels suburb of Schaerbeek. He had links to the jihadists who attacked Paris in 2015.

Cook, 32, resigned in February and in his first match under replacement Joe Root made 69 as England defeated South Africa by 211 runs at Lord's.
""I was having a laugh watching him in the field, running around in the covers,"" said Bayliss.
""He looked like he was enjoying it. For someone at this stage of his career, that's a good sign.""
Like Cook before him, Root began his reign as captain with a victory, scoring 190 in the first innings to help rescue England from 76-4.
At 26, the Yorkshire batsman had only captained in four previous first-class matches before taking on the England job.
""Before this Test he was a little more on edge than I've seen him before,"" said Bayliss. ""We spoke about Joe being himself, getting the message across in his way.
""He's proactive and confident and I thought that came across in the way he led the team.
""Root and Cook are different characters, they go about their batting in different fashion, so the dressing room was a little different. A lot of the messages were similar, just delivered in a different way.""
England have named an unchanged 12-man squad for the second Test of the four-match series against the Proteas at Trent Bridge, which begins on Friday.
That means the balance of the team is likely to remain the same, with left-arm spinner Liam Dawson continuing alongside Moeen Ali, who took 10 wickets at Lord's.
""The combination we had you could pretty much pick on any type of wicket,"" added Australian Bayliss, who further clarified Moeen's role in the team after saying on Sunday he thought his man-of-the-match performance could be a ""watershed"" moment.
""He wants to be in the team as a batter who bowls a little bit, so that is what we have chosen him as,"" said Bayliss.
""Mo is a bit of a complex character at times, so it's more for his benefit than anything. It takes the pressure off him. It doesn't mean he can't be the best spinner, but his number one job is to bat.
""This Test was probably a sign that this is the best way to go with him.""

Alastair Cook looks like has he gulped in a huge breath of fresh air by giving up the captaincy.
I interviewed him on the fourth morning and was able to draw a comparison between the Cook of now and the Cook I spoke to after the fifth Test against India in Chennai last year. It was like a different man.
Cook will not be a grumpy old pro, chuntering in the corner as the team move on. He will enjoy his cricket and bat the way he does. The 69 he made in the second innings was classic Cook - playing nicely without taking the attack apart.

139,"Gemma Flanagan rolled herself down the catwalk for the first time at a London fashion event on Wednesday.
""It was so amazing to do it and not fall off. My biggest worry was I'd roll off the end or the side,"" she said.
Before an illness left her unable to walk, she worked as an air hostess and part-time model.
""I surprisingly felt just as confident as I have done in the past which, considering it was the first one in my chair, I wasn't sure how I'd cope with.
""When you're walking you can kind of have a little strut and do your thing. That's what I was worried about - not being able to show the clothes off as well.
""The designer's just so pleased with how I showcased their items and at the end of the day that's what modelling's about.""
The fashion show was planned by the group Models of Diversity which campaigns for the fashion and beauty industries to represent diversity, and took place at the Ideal Home Show in London's Olympia.
Gemma, who is celebrating her 32nd birthday this week, wants using disabled models to be the norm.
""The more people that are open to using models with disabilities then the more people will see it as normal.
""We've all been in campaigns that have been a one-off for companies and a lot of them aren't paid either.
""It would be good to use models with disabilities just as models, not as one-offs - we're better than that,"" she says.
As for her future, she says: ""I've got a hair show in May and a couple of shoots lined up with local photographers.
""I want to do a lot more using my chair. I'm in it near enough all of the time now. Part of me doing this show was to embrace myself and embrace the fact that the chair isn't the enemy anymore.
""It's basically seeing past the metal and the wheels and just saying, 'that's a gorgeous model' rather than 'a girl in a chair'.""
In 2011 Gemma was diagnosed with Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome, a serious condition which affects the nervous system.
She spent seven months in rehab trying to learn to speak, write and walk again.
Recently though she says she's found it harder to walk with crutches and has become increasingly reliant on her wheelchair.
""When I got ill they were hoping I'd make a full recovery,"" she said.
""But I've started getting worse again and the consultant thinks this may be the best I'm ever going to be.

140,"Chinese electronics firm Hangzhou Xiongmai issued the recall soon after its cameras were identified as aiding the massive web attacks.
They made access to popular websites, such as Reddit, Twitter, Spotify and many other sites, intermittent.
Security experts said easy-to-guess default passwords, used on Xiongmai webcams, aided the hijacking.
The web attack enrolled thousands of devices that make up the internet of things - smart devices used to oversee homes and which can be controlled remotely.
In a statement, Hangzhou Xiongmai said hackers were able to take over the cameras because users had not changed the devices' default passwords.
Xiongmai rejected suggestions that its webcams made up the bulk of the devices used in the attacks.
""Security issues are a problem facing all mankind,"" it said. ""Since industry giants have experienced them, Xiongmai is not afraid to experience them once, too.""
It has also pledged to improve the way it uses passwords on its products and will send customers a software patch to harden devices against attack.
The recall affects all the circuit boards and components made by Hangzhou Xiongmai that go into webcams. It is not clear how effective the recall will be in reducing the numbers of vulnerable devices hackers can call on to mount attacks.
Yes, and it probably will. The smart devices making up the IoT are proving very popular with the malicious hackers who make their living by selling attack services or extorting cash by threatening firms with devastating attacks.
Before the rise of the IoT it was tricky to set up a network of hijacked machines as most would be PCs that, generally, are more secure. Running such a network is hard and often machines had to be rented for a few hours just to carry out attacks. Now anyone can scan the net for vulnerable cameras, DVRs and other gadgets, take them over and start bombarding targets whenever they want.
For the same reason you would care if your car was stolen and used by bank robbers as a getaway vehicle.
And because if your webcam, printer or DVR is hijacked you have, in effect, allowed a stranger to enter your home. Hackers are likely to start using these gadgets to spy on you and scoop up valuable data. It's worth taking steps to shut out the intruders.
Not easily. Many of the devices being targeted are hard to update and the passwords on some, according to one report, are hard-coded which means they cannot be changed.
There is also the difficulty of identifying whether you are using a vulnerable product. A lot of IoT devices are built from components sourced from lots of different places. Finding out what software is running on them can be frustrating.
Also, even if recalls and updates are massively successful there will still be plenty of unpatched devices available for malicious hackers to use. Some manufacturers of cheaper devices have refused to issue updates meaning there is a ready population of vulnerable gadgets available.
Because security costs money and electronics firms want to make their IoT device as cheap as possible. Paying developers to write secure code might mean a gadget is late to market and is more expensive. Plus enforcing good security on these devices can make them harder to use  - again that might hit sales.
Despite this, many industry bodies are trying to draw up standards that enforce good security habits. Unfortunately, these initiatives are taking time to have any impact, meaning there are millions of insecure devices already installed and working.
Right now, we don't know. Some hacker groups have claimed responsibility but none of their claims are credible. We might never know because the vulnerable devices making up the IoT attack network are changing hands regularly as rivals scramble to gain control of as many as they can.
In one sense the large web attacks are marketing exercises which show how effective a particular network of bots can be when turned against a target. Competition among rival bot operators is ferocious so a successful attack can be a good way to impress potential customers. It might also persuade victims of extortion emails to pay up rather than risk being knocked out.

People in parts of Kendal and Egremont have been advised to leave and stay with their family or friends.
Police in Cumbria have warned drivers to avoid unnecessary journeys.
BBC reporter Andy Gill, in Grasmere, said many roads in the area had minor flooding.

142,"Thomas Wainwright was on the wrong side of the road and travelling at speeds of up to 95mph in his Maserati hire car, just minutes before the crash.
The 27-year-old ploughed into the Berlingo van driven by Theresa Wade, 29, on Mull in October 2015.
The court heard Wainwright had been drinking cider and whisky for eight and a half hours before the crash.
He will be sentenced next month.
During the trial Wainwright and his passenger,  42-year-old Jerome Lopez, had claimed that Miss Wade had been on the wrong side of the road and caused the accident but the jury did not believe them.
Witnesses from Mull told how Wainwright, who was with Mr Lopez, his mother's partner, had been drinking at a hotel, a pub and a distillery in Tobermory before having another two pints of cider in the Craignure Inn.
As he headed back towards Tobermory on the wrong side of the road his hire car smashed into the van driven by Miss Wade.
The court heard Wainwright was on Mull, along with members of his family, visiting his sick grandmother. He had flown into Edinburgh airport and hired the Maserati.
Prosecutor Tim Niven-Smith revealed that Wainwright, who worked as the first officer on the Â£6.26m yacht MY Mahogany based in the south of France, had a previous conviction for driving while unfit through drink or drugs.
At a court in Nice he was fined 700 euros and given a suspended sentence.

IS was previously driven out of the ancient desert city of Palmyra in March with the support of Russian air strikes, but the jihadist group seized it again in a sudden assault that started last week.
The surprise setback for Syrian government forces came as they and their allies turned their attention to fighting local opposition forces in Aleppo and Damascus.

He was elected in May. In his previous role as mayor of Davao city, Mr Duterte built a reputation for blunt speaking and supporting the extrajudicial killings of suspected criminals.

McCormick said in a statement on Thursday that it was now ""willing to consider increasing its latest offer"".
Meanwhile Japanese noodle maker Nissin Foods has agreed to buy a 17.27% stake in Premier Foods.
Nissin, which Premier describes as a ""long-term shareholder"", is expected to take a seat on the Premier board.
McCormick, known for its Schwartz spices and Lawry's seasonings, first made a bid of 52p a share last month and then raised it to 60p a share on 14 March.
Premier rejected it ""on the basis that it significantly undervalued the company and its prospects"".
Now McCormick has said it may be prepared to increase its offer following ""limited confirmatory due diligence"", i.e. a review of Premier's pensions documentation, current trading and material contracts.
McCormick said ""it would be an outstanding custodian for the Premier Foods brands and, can provide benefits for Premier Foods, its pensioners, creditors and other stakeholders, which Premier Foods' current capital structure cannot deliver.""
Some shareholders are keen for Premier to seek a higher offer.
David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, the fund arm of insurer Standard Life, which controls 7% of Premier, said: ""Although we believe the 60p  bid indicated by McCormick is too low, we remain open to a bid at a higher level.
""We expect the Premier Foods Board, on behalf of its shareholders, to engage with McCormick and pursue this option to the full.""
Premier shares have been on a roller coaster ride this week, soaring 50% on Wednesday following news of the McCormick bid, falling by more than 10% on Thursday on the announcement of the Nissin stake and then recouping nearly all their losses as McCormick said it might be prepared to pay more.
Premier used to be one of the UK's biggest food groups but came unstuck when it expanded too fast, loading itself with debt.
It has since sold off its Hovis bread business to the US-based Gores group, rebuilt its £20m production line at its Mr Kipling bakery in Barnsley and pushed through a £1.1bn refinancing package, which included a £353m rights issue.
It still owns a range of household UK brands such as Ambrosia rice pudding, Oxo stock cubes and Batchelors soups.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission looked into police actions.
An inquest found 14 DJ announcements in 30 minutes had been the most significant cause of overcrowding.
About 900 students travelled to the club from around the country and the DJs called for universities to leave one after the other, often with just a few minutes between them.
The IPCC investigation found it more than likely police had not been informed of the event and was only alerted when a large number of people began arriving at the club.
The report said there is ""sufficient evidence to suggest the decisions and actions of the police during the incident were appropriate"".
It added there was ""no evidence of a criminal offence having been committed by any police officer"".
The report concluded that ""every officer involved made a significant contribution to the effective policing of the tragedy"".
During an inquest last week, it was reported that a series of announcements reminding people not to miss their coaches had been made in the early hours of 19 October.

It was delayed by several months as the firm grappled with software issues.
""We've run into a few limitations in our initial user experience goals due to some iOS restrictions,"" Light Phone said in a statement.
""They are not going to affect the experience of being light, but will make turning on call forwarding a little bit more manual.""

The Light Phone contains a 2G micro Sim card for communicating with its ""parent"" smartphone but some backers are now expressing concerns on Kickstarter that the phone will not work in countries like Australia and Singapore where there are plans to switch off 2G.
Joe Hollier said the firm had contacted backers in affected regions and offered them refunds.
""Most people who launch a Kickstarter campaign set very ambitious targets about when they are going to ship,"" said analyst Ben Wood from CCS Insight.
""The grim reality is that it's not just about delivering the product, there are lots of things that go around it, like CE marking, regulatory approval and standards testing. It all takes time and costs money.

Lancashire began their second innings 119 in front, but needing to press on to have a chance of a positive result.
They lost Paul Horton and Karl Brown in reaching stumps on 39-2, a lead of 158.
With so much time lost to the weather, a draw appears the only realistic result unless Lancashire collapse spectacularly on the final morning or skittle Leicestershire after setting them a target.
Having begun play at 12:15 BST, only 13 overs were possible before the players were forced from the field again until 17:30 BST.
Tom Wells was lbw to Jarvis in the first phase of play, but the key wicket of Mark Cosgrove for 79 went to former Leicestershire seamer Nathan Buck, who took 3-64.
Leicestershire seamer Clint McKay:

160,"Nigel Farage is wondering why, as Jonathan Portes has been pointing out, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures for migration to the UK from other EU countries is so much lower than the number of National Insurance numbers allocated to EU nationals.
According to the most recent comparable statistics, migration to the UK from the rest of the EU was 257,000 in the year to September 2015, but during the same period, 655,000 EU nationals registered for National Insurance numbers (Ninos).
Mr Farage smells a rat: ""They are pulling the wool over our eyes. Ninos are a simple and clear reflection of the real numbers of people in this country, as without them you can neither legally work, nor claim benefits.""
Now the government has promised to tell us how many of the Ninos issued are still active - in other words, how many of the EU citizens who registered are currently paying UK tax or claiming benefits.
But are Ninos a good measure of immigration?
There is no question that the official immigration figures, based on a survey taken at ports and airports, are imprecise, with the ONS 95% confident that the immigration figure is within plus or minus 23,000 of the true figure.
More importantly, though, the ONS figures only aim to measure long-term migration. They use the UN's definition of a long-term migrant as someone who moves country for a year or more.
When it comes to National Insurance numbers, on the other hand, there is no minimum stay in the UK. Everyone who wants to work in the UK must have a National Insurance number, even if they're only working in the country for a few weeks.
What's more, Ninos are unique to an individual, so once you've received one, it's yours forever. This means that not all those who HMRC reveal to be ""active"" will necessarily belong to people who have been in the country continuously since their number was issued - they could have left and returned.
The ONS statistics also include people who are not planning to work or claim benefits, such as children or non-working partners. These people don't need a Nino when they arrive, but can apply for one in the future. This means someone registering for a Nino could have arrived at any time, not necessarily in the year or quarter in question.
It's not hard to see how the two sets of figures would be different. The question is, should they vary this much, or is there a problem with the way the ONS currently gathers its data? HMRC has said it will work with the ONS to help reconcile all available sources of statistics, including Ninos, to ensure the figures are as accurate as possible.
With this process rumbling on - and the latest immigration and Nino statistics due out on 26 May - this issue is sure to keep providing fuel for the EU debate, coming just a month before the referendum.
Reality Check verdict: There are good reasons why the two numbers would be different, but they are strikingly far apart, and next month's figures showing how many of the numbers are active should help reconcile the two.

162,"Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats opposed new thresholds on when strikes can take place.
The vote against Conservative ministers' Trade Union Bill is not legally binding.
The UK and Welsh governments disagree over whether the assembly's permission is needed before the new rules apply to public sector workers in Wales.
The bill would require at least half of union members to take part in a ballot before a strike can happen.
In public services such as health, education and the fire service, industrial action would need at least 40% of eligible union members to vote in favour.
The Conservatives say the bill should apply to the whole of Britain, but Welsh government ministers say the assembly's consent is needed.
On Tuesday, AMs withheld their approval of the bill by voting down a motion in the Senedd chamber.
Labour has said it will try to overturn the bill if the UK government ignores the assembly' vote and pushes ahead.
If returned to power at May's assembly election, Labour would introduce its own legislation to repeal the bill.
Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews said: ""In Wales we have a good record of resolving disputes.
""There was no junior doctors' strike in Wales, there was in England.
""Fire fighters took industrial action in England over pensions, they were not doing so in Wales.
""In contrast, we believe this bill, the Trade Union Bill, will lead to a confrontational relationship between employers and the workforce.""
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said he supported the role of trade unions in standing up for members.
But, referring to the general secretary of the Unite union, he said: ""Where I will not stand up and support is for Len McCluskey, or his mob, to use you lot [Labour AMs] to live their ambitions.""

164,"The measure is ""an attack on democracy"" according to an emergency motion carried unanimously at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers conference.
Earlier ATL general secretary Mary Bousted called the plan ""madness"".
On Monday, School Minister Nick Gibb said the plan made schools ""profession-led"" - though he faced some heckling.
Under the plan almost 17,000 schools which have not already converted to academy status - mostly primaries - must do so by 2020 or have committed to do so by 2022.
Delegates applauded as the ATL became the third teachers' union to oppose the plans.
The conference, meeting in Liverpool, voted to condemn the White Paper, Educational Excellence Everywhere, as ""an attack on democracy"".
Proposing the motion, Mark Baker said White Paper's proposals amounted to ""Educational Excellence All Over The Place"".
The motion warned that conversion of schools to academy status would be achieved without regard to the wishes of parents, staff or local communities and without proper Parliamentary scrutiny.
The move represented ""ever greater centralism and micro-management"".
""It takes no account of the growing evidence of failing academies but insists on a blind adherence to an ideology with no foundation in fact,"" said the motion.
The ATL will now work with ""all those concerned"", including other education unions to opposed forced academisation and to consider what forms of action - including potential industrial action - may be needed.
In her speech to conference on Tuesday morning, Dr Bousted backed calls for a co-ordinated response.
""Alone we can do something. Together we can do great things.
""We must fight together to protect our profession, for the sake of the children and young people whose education depends on us.
""And we will fight and if we fight together, with parents and councillors, with other unions, with politicians, with governors, with the whole of civil society which opposes the madness of forced academisation, then we will win,"" Dr Bousted concluded.
Earlier in the speech Dr Bousted called the white paper a ""very strange document"".
""It asks us to believe six impossible things before breakfast, including the big whopper - that the forced academisation of all schools will improve educational standards.""
The government's plans have drawn criticism from teachers, unions and Tory local councillors.
At its conference over Easter, the National Union of Teachers  voted to ballot for strike action over the academies plan.
The NASUWT conference also voted to consider strike action if forced academisation affects members' pay and conditions.
The Labour Party has said its own analysis of official figures suggests the plan could cost £1.3bn with a shortfall in funding of  over £1.1bn - though ministers reject these figures.
But in a speech to the NASUWT Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said there was no going back on plans to make every school an academy by 2020.
Ms Morgan maintained the government's plans would improve the education system in England.
The Department for Education said it was ""disappointing that the ATL would rather play politics with our children's future than work constructively with us to deliver our vision for educational excellence everywhere"".
The ""vast majority"" of schools which had already became academies were ""now thriving"", said a spokesman.

Bosnian Serb officials warned the move would trigger a ""serious crisis"" in the country.
In 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) cleared Serbia of direct responsibility for genocide.
The ICJ found only one act of genocide during Bosnia's 1992-95 war - the massacre of about 8,000 Bosnian Muslim (Bosniak) men and boys by Bosnian Serb forces in the town of Srebrenica in 1995.
It was Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two.
The ICJ ruled that Serbia had violated international law by failing to prevent the killings, but absolved it of direct responsibility.
On Thursday, Mr Izetbegovic told reporters that ""the request [for a review] is being submitted at this very moment"".
""I think that I am on the path of truth and justice,"" he added.
The appeal was launched before a 10-year deadline expires on 26 February.
Mladen Ivanic, the Serb member of the presidency, said the move should have been made collectively by the tripartite body, where a Bosnian Croat also has a seat.
""I am afraid that we have entered a really serious crisis,"" Mr Ivanic said.
Meanwhile, Serbia Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic earlier described Mr Izetbegovic's intentions as ""bad"" for relations between the two countries.
Following the 1992-1995 war, Bosnia is now an independent state under international administration.
Its three main ethnic groups are Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), Croats and Serbs.

Excluding one-off items, profits on the CCS measure were $3.86bn, up 136%.
Shell joins rivals BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Total in reporting better-than-expected results.
More than $1bn in cost savings and budget cuts made over the past three years from cost-cuts and assets sales have also helped to increase cash flow and boost profits.

172,"Mr Blackman is championing an e-petition demanding the change in Parliament, after it was signed by more than 120,000 people.
Muslims and Hindus should have ""the most important days in their faiths recognised in law"", the petition says.
The government has already rejected the e-petitioners' request.
In its response to the petition, the government said: ""We are very aware of the importance of these festivals which are widely celebrated in the UK.
""Whilst we appreciate a new national holiday may benefit some communities and sectors, the cost to the economy remains considerable and any changes to the current arrangements would not take place without a full consultation.""
Mr Blackman pressed ministers to reconsider during a debate in the House of Commons' secondary debating chamber of Westminster Hall.
He said the government's concern about cost was ""valid"".
The MP for Harrow East said: ""According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research, each public holiday costs Â£2.3bn per day due to a loss of retail, commercial services, and other industries.
""So we're looking at an overall economic cost of just under Â£5bn if the Muslim faith and the Hindu faith were to be given one specified public holiday each, if the estimate is correct.""
But, he continued, the think tank had also estimated that annual output would be raised by Â£19bn ""if all public holidays were scrapped"".
""That's not likely to happen. I can't believe any government would every dare to decide to cancel Christmas,"" Mr Blackman said.
""So we can't make a case for or against further public holidays just on the basis of money. If we did, we wouldn't have any public holidays at all.""
There were ""bigger considerations"", he argued.
""Wouldn't it be a statement that we as a nation embrace these religions, and the people who hold them dear, and we are ready to recognise their place in our society?
""Creating these public holidays would be an important step towards promoting the understanding and tolerance of different faiths - not just at home, but abroad too.
""We want other nations to look to the UK for a good example of positive integration, and for highly skilled prospective immigrants to consider coming to our country with a sense that their faith is a respected part of their identity.""
But Business Minister Jenny Willott was not persuaded by the MP's case.
""We are very lucky in this country to have such a hugely diverse and mixed and vibrant society that we all benefit from,"" she told MPs.
""Faith groups play a hugely important role in making life better for other people and making communities a better place for people to live.""

Current government plans include some tunnels but leaves about eight miles in exposed or partially-covered cuttings.
HS2 said it had ""considered"" further tunnelling but stood by its plans.
Plans for the HS2 between London and Birmingham and then to Manchester and Leeds have been developed by the government under holding company HS2 Ltd.
It promises to reduce journey times between Birmingham and London from 81 to 49 minutes, and slash the trip to Manchester by an hour, to 68 minutes.
The new Chilterns Long Tunnel Route report, produced by Peter Brett Associates, was commissioned by Chiltern District Council, Aylesbury Vale District Council, Buckinghamshire County Council and the Chilterns Conservation Board to look at alternative proposals.
The group said the planned route through the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) would result in an ""adverse and irreversible impact"" on the landscape.
HS2 Ltd's proposal includes about 13km (8 miles) in a tunnel from the M25 to Little Missenden and 12km (7.5 miles) on two viaducts, in two green tunnels and either on embankments or in cuttings.
The new plan includes a 24.2km (15 mile) tunnel from the M25 to Wendover, the first 9km (5.5 miles) of which would follow the exact alignment of the government scheme.
The report concluded a long tunnel was ""technically feasible"", would protect the landscape and ""be a better route operationally"".
It is the second time the group has proposed a tunnel scheme but it said the latest proposal would have less impact on the countryside.
The cost is estimated at Â£1.85bn, as opposed to the government's Â£1.45bn plan, but campaigners said this was ""a small price to pay"" to ""preserve a beautiful and unique part of the countryside"".

175,"The report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found an average satisfaction score of 7.3 on a scale from nought to 10.
UK teenagers had a below average satisfaction score of seven.
But anxiety about exams and bullying remains a problem for many young people. And heavy internet use leaves many feeling lonely and less satisfied.
The findings are based on a survey of 540,000 students internationally who also completed the OECD Pisa tests in science, mathematics and reading in 2015.
The study reveals large variations in life satisfaction out of 48 OECD countries and partner nations.
The highest levels of satisfaction were found in the Dominican Republic (8.5), Mexico (8.3) and Costa Rica (8.2), while the Asian countries or economies of Korea (6.4), Hong Kong (6.5), Macau (6.6) and Taiwan (6.6) recorded low levels of satisfaction.
The UK took 38th place for life satisfaction, behind countries such as Russia (7.8), Bulgaria (7.4) and Estonia (7.5).
The study found girls and disadvantaged students were less likely than boys and advantaged students to report high levels of life satisfaction.
Despite reasonably high average levels of satisfaction, bullying was a significant problem for many youngsters, with a large proportion saying they had been victims.
On average across OECD countries, about 11% of teenagers said they were frequently mocked, 7% were ""left out of things"" and 8% were the subject of hurtful rumours.
Around 4% of students - approximately one child per class - reported that they were hit or pushed at least a few times per month.
But the OECD research found less bullying in schools where students had positive relationships with their teachers.
Exam stress was also a problem, with 59% of students saying they often worried that taking a test would be difficult and 66% saying they worried about getting poor grades.
Across OECD countries, about 55% of students said they were very anxious before a test, even if they were well prepared for it.
Girls had a tendency to worry more than boys, with girls in all 72 countries reporting greater levels of schoolwork-related anxiety than boys.
The report found students spent more than two hours online during a typical weekday after school and more than three hours online during a typical weekend day.
The majority said the internet was a great resource for obtaining information and more than half said they felt bad if no internet connection was available.
Students who spent more than six hours online on weekdays outside of school hours were more likely to report that they were not satisfied with their life or that they felt lonely at school.
They were also less proficient in science than students who spent fewer hours online.
The OECD research found that between 2012 and 2015, the time teenagers spent online outside of school hours increased by at least 40 minutes a day on both weekdays and weekends.
The study concluded that teenagers who felt part of a school community and had good relationships with their parents and teachers were more likely to perform better academically and be happier with their lives.
Students who felt their teacher was willing to provide help and was interested in their learning were about 1.3 times more likely to feel that they belonged at school, researchers found.

176,"The Australian and Malaysian governments say the search will now focus on an area 1,100km (684 miles) north-east of the previous zone.
The move was based on further analysis of radar data that showed the plane was going faster, thus using more fuel.
The Beijing-bound airliner disappeared on 8 March with 239 people on board.
Malaysian officials have concluded that, based on satellite data, it flew into the sea somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. So far no trace of it has been found.
Search efforts had until Friday morning focused on an area some 2,500km (1,550 miles) to the south-west of the Australian city of Perth.
Did previous photos show plane debris?
Using satellite images, several nations have identified objects floating in the sea in that search area, but these have not been located and there is no evidence that they are related to the plane.
John Young, general manager of Amsa's emergency response division, said that teams had ""moved on"" from that area based on the new information.
Acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that the fact that the search area had moved did not discount the earlier satellite images of possible debris further south.
""Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week,"" Mr Hussein said.
A statement from Amsa - which is co-ordinating the search - said the new information had come from the international investigation team in Malaysia.
This was based on ""continuing analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca before radar contact was lost"", Amsa said.
""It indicated that the aircraft was travelling faster than previously estimated, resulting in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance the aircraft travelled south into the Indian Ocean.""
It said that the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) had determined that this was ""the most credible lead to where debris may be located"".
The new search area is about 1,850km west of Perth and covers some 319,000 sq km (123,000 sq miles).
Mr Young, of Amsa, said it represented the ""best estimate of the area in which the aircraft is likely to have entered the ocean"" and took account of possible drift.
The new search area was outside the ""roaring forties"" bad weather zone, meaning conditions were likely to be better. Aircraft would also be able to spend more time in the area because it was closer to land, Mr Young said.
The potential flight path could be the subject of further refinement as investigations continued, Amsa said, adding that satellites would now focus on the new area.
Amsa said nine military aircraft would be scouring the area on Friday, with a civilian aircraft acting as a communications relay.

177,"But back in the Indian Ocean island nation, many Tamils are either too scared of official retribution, or too apathetic to mark the second 27 November commemoration since the rebels' defeat last year.
The Sri Lankan government has meanwhile been busy destroying the war graves and other memorials for the 20,000 insurgents killed during the three-decade conflict.
One such cemetery has been turned into a playground; another in Jaffna was converted into an army camp.
And no-one knows what has happened to the records scrupulously kept by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who are thought to have financially supported the bereaved families.
Suresh Premachandiran, an MP from northern Jaffna, says his party, the Tamil National Alliance, has tried in vain to stop the demolition of war cemeteries.
""Destroying graves is unacceptable,"" he said. ""Those people who were buried there are humans. They fought for the Tamil people.""
He continued: ""Recently when some Tamil civilians lit lamps to mark a Hindu festival in Kilinochchi, the local police thought they were trying to pay homage to the LTTE war dead and beat up them up.""
In the past, large numbers of Tamils visited these war graves. In many places, cultural programmes would also take place.
But now they're not sure what to do.
""Those who lost their relatives would like to remember them,"" says Selva, a resident of Colombo, who did not want his full name published.
""But if they do any kind of public display - like garlanding the photos of people in LTTE uniform, they will be arrested.""
Sri Lanka's deputy high commissioner in the UK, P M Amza, defended his government's decision to demolish war graves, labelling them a rebel propaganda tool.
""We consider the LTTE a terrorist organisation,"" he said. ""We feel all those associated with it form part of terrorism.
""There is no evidence to show the LTTE represented collective Tamil aspiration. They have killed many Tamil leaders.""
Human rights groups say both government forces and the rebels committed crimes against humanity during the conflict.
The LTTE were accused of recruiting children and firing at fleeing civilians during the final weeks of war.
It is an established fact that the LTTE killed thousands of Tamil youths who joined other armed groups in the early years of the rebellion.
But many Tamils who are outspoken about the government's alleged war crimes say little about the charges against the LTTE.
For many in the diaspora across the world, Heroes' Day is an opportunity to gather and reaffirm their loyalty to the Tamil Tigers.
Large gatherings are planned in Britain, Canada, Switzerland, France and Australia.
Sam Krishna, media co-ordinator of the British Tamil Forum, said: ""In addition to remembering those who sacrificed their lives for the Tamil cause, we will use the occasion to focus on the war crimes.
""We will once again press for an independent inquiry.""
Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, killed on the last day of the conflict in May 2009, traditionally marked Heroes' Day with a speech outlining his agenda for the year ahead, and the Tigers would stage a military parade.
But no organisation in Sri Lanka plans to commemorate 27 November this year. Some even say the time has come to move on.
A refugee who lives in the government-run camp in Vavuniya, in the north, said: ""War has ended last year, but still we are in the camps. We lost everything due to war. There's no point in talking about it.""
Some expat Tamils feel that overseas organisations behind the Heroes' Day commemorations would do better to use their resources helping those back home who are struggling to restart their lives.

178,"The excerpts, released on Monday, excluded the names of gunman Omar Mateen as well as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called Islamic State (IS).
Mateen, who killed 49 people at a gay Orlando nightclub, described himself as an ""Islamic soldier"" and pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi during his phone calls to authorities.
But in the first version of the transcript, any reference to IS or their leader was removed.
For example:
Police: What's your name?
Mateen: My name is I pledge allegiance to [omitted].
The decision to omit the names sparked outrage among Twitter users including US House Speaker Paul Ryan.
The Wisconsin Republican denounced the decision to redact as ""preposterous"" and called on the Obama administration to release the full transcript ""so the public is clear-eyed about who did this, and why"".
""We know the shooter was a radical Islamist extremist inspired by Isis. We also know he intentionally targeted the LGBT community,"" Mr Ryan said in a statement, referring to IS.
Other users expressed outrage over the decision to remove IS from the text.
The Department of Justice released a statement later on Monday defending the redaction.
Officials said they wanted to remain sensitive to the victims, their families and the ongoing investigation, while also not providing ""the killer or terrorist organisations with a publicity platform for hateful propaganda"".
""Unfortunately, the unreleased portions of the transcript that named the terrorist organisations and leaders have caused an unnecessary distraction from the hard work that the FBI and our law enforcement partners have been doing to investigate this heinous crime,"" the statement said, before releasing the full transcript of Mateen's first 50-second phone call.
The other calls he made were not released.
Mateen first called a 911 dispatcher about 30 minutes after he began shooting. During the call, Mateen spoke Arabic and praised ""God the Merciful"".
In a later phone call, he told a negotiator to tell America to stop bombing Syria and Iraq and that was why he was ""out here right now"", according to the FBI transcript.
Mateen also told negotiators he had an explosive vest similar to the kind used by terrorists ""in France,"" making a reference to the November terror attack in Paris. But no vests were found.
""[Mateen] does not represent the religion of Islam, but a perverted view,"" said Ron Hopper, the FBI assistant special agent in charge.

179,"There was also a record number of EU citizens coming to live in Britain with the figure standing at 284,000.
Net migration - immigration minus emigration - was the second-highest number on record.
Immigration minister Robert Goodwill said the government was ""committed to getting net migration down"".
Most of the period covered by the figures was before the EU referendum, but they also include one week after the poll.
The ONS says the net migration figure is similar to the previous year, although it was up slightly on the 12 months ending in March, when it stood at 326,000.
Immigration to the UK has also risen to a record level with 650,000 migrants in the year to June.
Net migration from the EU was the highest figure on record with the number standing at 189,000.
Mr Goodwill said the British people had sent out a ""clear message"" they want more control on immigration and the government was committed to getting numbers down to ""the tens of thousands"".
He added: ""That is why reducing the number of migrants coming to the UK will be a key priority of our negotiations to leave the EU.""
Figures show 311,000 people came to live in the UK for work-related reasons.
But the ONS said there was a ""statistically significant"" rise in the number of people who were ""looking for work"", 130,000, compared to 107,000 last year, as opposed to those who had a definite job to go to.
By Danny Shaw, BBC Home Affairs correspondent
The latest ONS figures have brought the government no Christmas cheer.
Immigration remains at historically high levels - and its target to get net migration to less than 100,000 remains a long way off.
Ministers hope the numbers will come down once they're able to exert more control over EU migration, currently at a record 284,000, when the UK leaves the Union.
However, that all depends on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations: will there be new restrictions on the ability of EU citizens to move freely from state to state?
One approach that might be considered is to limit travel to those who've got a firm offer of employment.
It won't have escaped the Home Office's notice that 82,000 EU migrants hadn't secured a job when they came to Britain - they arrived in order to look for work.
The ONS says that's a statistically significant increase of 21,000 on a year ago - and a record high.
Labour MP and chair of the home affairs select committee Yvette Cooper said the number of low-skilled workers coming to the UK was ""too high"" and her party ""should be talking about immigration"" as it was a concern for people right across the country.
She said the figures show the government's approach to immigration was not working and it also needed to look at different types of immigration.
For the first time, Romania tops the list for the country with the most number of migrants to the UK in 2015 - with 54,000 people coming to live in Britain.
China was in second place with 44,000 followed by Poland at 38,000 and India with 36,000.
UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said the figures ""just go to show that you can't trust the Tories to bring down immigration"".
He added: ""This is an abject failure, not just by the Government in general but by the prime minister in particular.""
Alp Mehmet from Migration Watch UK, which calls for a reduction in levels of immigration, said the figures show Britain needs to take a ""strong position on immigration in the Brexit negotiations"".
He added: ""Even if net migration was brought down to 265,000 a year the UK population would still be growing at half a million a year, every year for the next ten years. That is the equivalent to another five Birminghams. This is unacceptable to most of the British public.""
Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said it was ""too early to say what effect, if any the EU referendum has had on long-term international migration.""
She added: ""There does not however appear to have been any significant impact during the run-up to the vote.""
Correction: An earlier version of this report said net migration had reached a record level when it was actually just below the previous highest figure.

180,"These colourful lizards can scamper rapidly up walls, scuttle along ceilings and even hang upside down on polished glass.
Yet the secret of their amazing climbing ability remained a mystery until relatively recently.
The underside of a gecko's foot looks like a tyre tread and is covered in millions of microscopic hairs. Each hair splits into hundreds of tips just 200 billionths of a metre wide.
The secret of this lizard's adhesion turns out to be the relatively weak intermolecular forces that draw materials together any time they get close.
These van der Waals forces nevertheless explain how a gecko can support its own body weight on just one finger, and a single gecko hair can lift the weight of an ant.
To un-stick, the gecko pulls its foot away at a different angle.
""What we're talking about is something that is about as sticky as sticky tape - it's not crazy glue,"" says Prof Kellar Autumn, who became intrigued by gecko adhesion after being funded to develop climbing robots by the US military.
Prof Autumn, from Lewis & Clark College in Oregon, added: ""What is special about it is that it is controllable. And its controllability is based on geometry and physics, not chemistry.""
The effort to uncover the mechanisms behind gecko climbing has already yielded synthetic material that sticks in the same way.
Stick, peel and re-stick a piece of existing adhesive tape several times and it quickly loses its clingy properties.
Prof Autumn and Mark Cutkosky, from Stanford University, compared natural and polymer-based synthetic gecko hairs using a machine that simulated gecko climbing. This showed both versions could be re-used some 30,000 times without losing their stickiness.
Synthetic adhesives could yield transformative applications in robotics, industry, medicine, sports and clothing.
But one possible use always comes up in any popular discussion: could they allow humans to scale walls like Spider-Man?
In 2007, physicist and engineer Nicola Pugno, from Turin Polytechnic in Italy, calculated that a person wearing gloves and boots made of carbon nanotubes and structured to mimic gecko feet could indeed cling safely to a wall or a ceiling.
Challenges would include wear and tear and the propensity for dirt particles to collect and inhibit stickiness.
The suit would have to work on every kind of surface and for long periods of time. But Prof Pugno says: ""We are not very far, in my opinion, from a kind of Spider-Man suit.""
Prof Metin Sitti, from Carnegie Mellon University, says the idea is ""not impossible"". Selecting a lightweight person and applying the adhesive to many parts of the suit (not just the feet and hands) would improve the chances of success, he explains.
But, he comments: ""We get questions like: 'Can you carry a one-tonne weight'. And we say: 'Maybe, but that's not our biggest advantage'.""
A. The toes of geckos are covered in ridge-like lamellae, producing a tyre tread pattern
B. Millions of microscopic hairs, or setae, cover each toe. These are only as long as two diameters of a human hair
C. Each seta ends in up to 1000 even tinier tips, called spatulae
D. The spatular tips are only 200 billionths of a metre wide -below the wavelength of visible light
Several institutes have been developing robots that can climb walls - Stanford University's ""Sticky-bot"" can be seen in action here. Some scientists envisage ""geckobots"" being used to search for survivors in a burning building or disaster zone, to explore the rocky terrain of Mars, or even as toys.
But many in the field are most excited by more routine applications.
Medicine is one target area for these adhesives. They could spawn advanced bandages that can be removed easily after healing or gripping surfaces on instruments designed for delicate surgery. Since the mechanism works in the wet, it could be used to affix implants within the body.
Stanislav Gorb, from the University of Kiel, studies biological adhesion; his work also looks at the way beetles stick to surfaces.
He says gecko material has several advantages when compared with generic sticky tape. There is no ""visco-elastic"" adhesive to dry out, so it stays attached for longer and leaves no residue.
But he says that with current production methods, they are unlikely to replace classical sticky tape.
""Maybe in 5-10 years we will have a method that will make the tape very cheap - right now it isn't. Secondly, right now, the forces are in the range or even lower than traditional sticky tape.""
Zip it up
Metin Sitti thinks gecko material could provide alternatives to current ""closure"" technologies, such as hook and loop fastening, zips and sealing systems on food packaging.
It is one area he is exploring through his company NanoGripTech, set up to commercialise his lab's gecko work.
Synthetic adhesives work best on glass; rough or uneven surfaces pose more of an obstacle. Getting high performance out of gecko material on a variety of surfaces and in different conditions represents the firm's first challenge.
""We have been focusing on what happens when the surface gets wet, oily, dirty and what happens when temperatures change from very cold to very hot,"" says Prof Sitti.
""The second challenge is how can you manufacture and sell this [material] at high volume and at low cost?""
Prof Sitti is working on this problem and expects within a year to begin manufacturing at low volumes.
A silicone-based bio-inspired adhesive made by German firm Binder has been on the market for some six months. Prof Gorb was involved with its development.
The company has been exploring medical applications and the ""pick and place"" technology used in clean rooms to precisely position components on to circuit boards.
""Clean rooms often work with suction systems. That generates dust and requires a lot of energy, which contributes to the cost,"" says Jan Tuma, managing director of Binder.
""We are only sticky on really flat, shiny surfaces. It depends on the pins per sq cm and at the moment we have 29,000 pins per sq centimetre.
""Geckos have more, but they have had millions of years to develop, and we have had only a few.""
Prof Autumn says: ""We can look to Nature as a giant library of design principles. The way gecko adhesives work is so bizarre and so different from the way that adhesives have been engineered, that I don't think we would have invented it.""

Charlie has been in intensive care in hospital since October last year.
His doctors said he cannot hear, move, cry or swallow and that his lungs only go up and down because he is on a machine that does it for him.
Judges in Strasbourg, France, had previously ruled an interim measure to keep him alive should remain in place until midnight on 19 June.
The new extension lasts until a final ruling is made.
A spokesperson said the court ""will treat the application with the utmost urgency"" but have not indicated when the final judgement will be made.
Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, have raised Â£1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for an experimental treatment in the US.
In April a High Court judge ruled against the trip to America and said Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity.

183,"After a year of music lessons, the reading scores of nine and 10-year-olds held steady compared to a dip seen in those who were not taught any music.
Another group of musically-trained children were found to be better at processing sounds and language.
The research is being presented to the American Psychological Association.
The research was led by Dr Nina Kraus at Northwestern University and involved hundreds of children at high schools in impoverished areas of Chicago and Los Angeles.
Her research had previously highlighted that learning music could improve the concentration, memory and focus of children in the classroom by improving their neural functions.
But much of the research had focused on the impact of music lessons on relatively affluent children.
In this study, Dr Kraus found that giving children regular group music lessons for five or more hours a week prevented any decline in reading skills, which would normally be expected in poorer areas.
Another group of teenage schoolchildren, from a poor area of Chicago, took part in band practice or choir practice every day at school as part of a music project.
Researchers recorded their brainwaves to assess how they responded to speech sounds.
After two years of musical training, the results showed the musical group was faster and more accurate at distinguishing one sound from another, particularly when there was background noise, compared to a group that did not participate in any musical activity.
Dr Kraus said this showed music could have a positive impact on the brain, which could also help learning, but it was not a quick fix.
""Research has shown that there are differences in the brains of children raised in impoverished environments that affect their ability to learn,"" he explained.
""While more affluent students do better in school than children from lower income backgrounds, we are finding that musical training can alter the nervous system to create a better learner and help offset this academic gap.""
All the children had similar IQs and reading ability at the start of the study.
Dr Kraus said music appeared to remodel the brain to improve the connections between sounds and meaning, the process by which babies learn to speak.
Children growing up in poorer areas with poorly-educated mothers are more likely to have 'noisier brains', she said.
This is because they are less likely to know and recognise a wide range of words and are therefore less able to respond to sounds and language.
""Music automatically sharpens the nervous system's response to sounds,"" Dr Kraus explained.
The children participating in the study were part of the Harmony Project, which provides instruments and free music tuition for American schoolchildren in certain deprived urban areas.

187,"Making them vote may halt declining election turnouts and could ""kick start the habit of a lifetime"", the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said.
In 2010, 44% of 18 to 24-year-olds voted, with the ""younger and poorer"" least likely to vote, it suggested.
The UK risks ""sleepwalking into a more divided democracy"" unless there is reform, the IPPR's Mat Lawrence said.
""The working class and the young have less input into political decision-making processes, with lower rates of participation and representation than older and more affluent citizens,"" the IPPR report suggested.
Such inequalities undermined the ""legitimacy and effectiveness"" of democracy, the report claimed, saying it was unlikely the trend would be reversed in next month's general election.
At the 1970 general election, the gap between the proportion of 18-24 year olds and over-65s who voted was 18%.
However, at the 2010 general election, the gap had risen to 32% - with 76% of over-65s voting, compared to 44% of 18-24 year olds.
""Long-run decline in voter turnout in the UK is being driven by the relative collapse in participation among the young and the less well-off - not by a uniform decline in turnout among all groups,"" Mr Lawrence added.
""A distinctive non-voting population, generally younger and poorer, heightens political inequality by giving some groups far greater influence at the ballot box.""
The report comes after the voting age was reduced to 16 for the Scottish independence referendum, in September - when 109,593 16 and 17-year-olds registered to vote.
Mr Lawrence said the high turnout at the referendum, as well as the rise of grassroots groups, provided reasons for optimism.
Broadcaster and author Rick Edwards told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he supported the proposal, saying ""something drastic needs to happen"" to encourage young people to vote.
But he said there would have to be a ""none of the above"" option on ballot papers, to allow voters to express their dissatisfaction.
""The problem is politicians are more interested in serving the interests of the demographic who vote more because they are interested in winning their votes and keeping their votes.
""Therefore what is happening is that young people are getting marginalised and their interests aren't being served as they should be,"" he added.
He said that if young people felt they were not being spoken to, or were not being paid any attention by politicians, they would be even less likely to vote.

188,"Eleven million documents held by the Panama-based company Mossack Fonseca were leaked to German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).
In Russia, the three main pro-Kremlin TV channels have not reported the story so far.
This is quite typical behaviour for Russia's mainstream broadcasters, which often steer clear of controversial topics involving Russian leaders.
The leak reveals a suspected money-laundering ring run by a Russian bank and involving close associates of President Vladimir Putin.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations: ""Even though Vladimir Putin is not explicitly mentioned anywhere, it is obvious for us that our president has been and will be the main target.""
The story is covered by privately owned business channel RBK and independent digital news channel Dozhd TV - sources that seldom shy away from major international stories that cast Russia in an unfavourable light.
The ICIJ report was released late on Sunday night in Moscow, missing print deadlines for newspapers.
But the ICIJ's Russian partner, the opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, featured a seven-page hard copy report and a large online version on its website. Since then, most of the popular online news sources have included reports on the story.
There has been plenty of chatter on social media. The hashtag #panamapapers has been in and out of the Top 10 Twitter trends for Russia since Sunday evening.
It seems the story has underwhelmed many Russian bloggers, who were not surprised to learn about potential large-scale corruption. There have been plenty of sarcastic jokes about the alleged sums involved.
In Germany, Munich's Sueddeutsche Zeitung - which originally received the documents - has the online headline ""Putin's rich friends - the trail of the secret money"".
The heavyweight Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung says ""Panama's state prosecutors investigate offshore firms"", while Berlin's Die Welt reports on ""The billion-dollar trails of a global affair"".
The tabloid Bild says ""Data leak reveals shady transactions worth billions"".
China's press is quiet on allegations that the Panama Papers involve Chinese nationals, partly because it is a national holiday, the Qingming Festival.
News outlets have reported the story, omitting any mention of China being involved.  However, it appears that dialogue on the papers is now being censored, as features on the Sina and NetEase web portals have been removed.
There are indications that Weibo social media users want to talk about it, with thousands of posters attempting to discuss the story using the hashtag #PanamaPapers.
Weibo shows that more than 2,000 users have used this hashtag, but posts using it appear currently unavailable to view.
A search of ""Panama"" on verified media accounts brings up no results, suggesting that the microblog's moderators wish to limit people from searching for this term.

190,"Passengers said it was ""chaotic"", with huge crowds snaking around corridors and a lack of senior staff.
Airport operator BAA said UK Border Agency's service was ""completely unacceptable"" but queues were easing.
The agency blamed the Easter holiday for the length of the queues.
BAA said queues began easing after 13:00 BST with passengers in Terminal 5 having to wait the longest - 31 minutes for EU passengers and 51 minutes for Non-EU citizens.
The shortest waiting time was in Terminal 4, where it took four minutes for passengers from the EU to clear the checks and two minutes for non-EU nationals.
BAA said on Friday the longest wait passengers had was 77 minutes at Terminal 3, 75 minutes at Terminal 4, and 54 minutes at Terminals 5 and 1, with non-EU passengers facing the longest wait at the time.
Matthew Donaldson, 38, from Lincolnshire, who arrived on a flight from Cape Town in South Africa at about 06:30, said he had to wait for an hour and 45 minutes to leave passport control at Terminal 5.
He said: ""It was complete chaos. Half the escalators were closed to slow down the crowds and when we got to passport control there were snaking queues.
""They gave no reason and there were no senior staff there.
""It was erratic to say the least.""
George Galanopoulos, founder of London Executive Aviation which runs private jets, wrote on Twitter: ""Just landed at Heathrow T5... total chaos! Embarrassing for London.""
Simon Baugh, director of media relations at BAA, said the earlier situation at passport control, which is managed by the UK Border Force, the section of the UK Border Agency in charge of entry to the UK, was ""fairly typical"" but ""completely unacceptable"".
He said: ""It's the UK's reputation and BAA's that suffers. There's no need for it.
""It's entirely about the level of resourcing the government needs to put in place.""
A UK Border Agency spokeswoman said: ""We will not compromise border security but we always aim to keep disruption to a minimum by using our staff flexibly to meet demand.""
She said there were extra workers at the border over the Easter period.
Culture Select Committee chairman John Whittingdale outlined his committee's concerns about the airport's service in a letter to Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Jeremy Hunt which was made public this week.
The letter, dated 21 March, said waits in excess of an hour might deter tourists from returning to the UK.
The government sets BAA targets for processing departing passengers through security but no contractual service level agreements are in place for arriving passengers, said Mr Baugh.
He said the Home Office sets an ""aspirational"" waiting time of no longer than 45 minutes for non-EU passengers and 25 minutes for EU passengers.
Mr Baugh said: ""That bears no relation to customer experience."" A summary is",Passengers have faced waits of more than an hour at passport control at London's Heathrow Airport two days after it was revealed MPs warned it may struggle to cope during the Olympics.,None,generation
191,"At first sight, with billions in subsidies, you might think that every farmer would automatically want to keep the cash flowing and therefore choose to stay in.
But it's not so simple.
In 2014, the most recent year with confirmed figures, UK farms received Â£3.19bn. The average payment was Â£17,735. The highest was almost Â£2m.
For many farmers, particularly those working marginal land such as hills with poor soil, the subsidies act as a lifeline.
Mark Williams runs a farm perched on steep slopes near Welshpool in Wales with a spectacular view over the Severn Valley.
Sitting on his quad bike, a flock of sheep grazing nearby, he describes the payments as essential to keep communities like his going.
He says hill farming is very difficult and that the margins on beef and sheep alone are very tight, ""so the subsidy is very important to protect those farms"".
But travel the short distance from the Welsh uplands to the rich soils of Shropshire near Telford and you hear a very different story.
Bruce Udale and his daughter Isabel Moseley, who grow animal feed on their 1,200 acres, are both determined to leave the EU.
This is farming on an industrial scale, with huge fields and impressive machinery. We watch a giant tractor extend two vast arms to spray a bright green crop of wheat.
The farm attracts tens of thousands of pounds in CAP payments, but Bruce and Isabel are convinced that British farmers would be better off without them.
In their view, the subsidies swirling through the agricultural economy artificially inflate prices which means - according to Bruce - that the payments are not worth as much as they sound.
""If we don't have subsidies"", he says, ""I believe our costs would come down. Land values would probably come down, rents would certainly come down, machinery costs would come down because a lot of these things are priced at what the market thinks we've got in our pockets.
""So the loss would not be as great as many people think.""
And, because the payments come from the EU via the UK government, there is notorious bureaucracy. Isabel says it's hugely time-consuming and she resents it.
""For our children's future we should take things back in hand, make our own rules and regulations in Great Britain for our benefit.
""Now we have Brussels making our decisions. Yes, we have a slight input, but we can't change anyone's minds.""
On his hill farm, Mark Williams has an answer to that.
""If they think there's going to be any less regulation, the UK is not going to revoke sheep tagging, they're not going to revoke the licences, they're not going to revoke the burial of livestock.
""We're still going to have to put up with all of that.""
What about access to markets? Of the UK's agricultural exports, just over 63% went to the EU with about 36% going to the rest of the world.
Mark says that makes the EU a crucial outlet.
""Over 90% of British beef and lamb ends up in the EU. With such a high number, to mess about with that could have big consequences.""
But Bruce Udale argues that if the UK did withdraw, trade with Europe would not be over.
""With everything except sheep, we import more than we export, so I don't have too many worries that the EU would want to do a reasonable deal with us.""
Another hot topic is labour. About 24,000 farm workers have come from the rest of the EU and at harvest-time the most labour-intensive farms - cultivating fruit and veg - require far more.
There are no exact numbers but some estimates suggest that around 60,000, mainly East Europeans, come for the summer.
Hidden behind tall hedgerows near Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire is Eric Drummond's fruit farm, where as many as 350 Bulgarians and Romanians work at breakneck speed, picking strawberries in huge plastic polytunnels.
Without EU membership, he fears that the supply would simply dry up and paralyse production.
""It's a huge risk to your business, to any horticultural business. The whole industry relies on this labour coming into the country. So we are personally in favour of staying in because there's no word on what happens if we come out.""
But like every point in this debate, there's a counter-argument.
Bruce Udale says there could be a scheme, similar to one that operated in recent years, where foreign workers could be brought in for a temporary period.
""I say tick them in, know where they're going, tick them out when they've finished. We can't have them just coming and going.""
Farmers themselves are probably too small in number to make much of a difference in the vote, but their sector of the economy is hugely important.
Not only does the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) command the largest share of the EU budget, but also the farms themselves provide much of the food we eat.
And how that work is carried out, and how it's organised, shapes the landscape itself. A summary is",Behind the quiet tapestry of farmland stretching across the UK is a turbulent debate over Britain's membership of the European Union.,None,generation

However American Williams, 35, won four games on the trot to set up a semi-final against Roberta Vinci.
Konta's form will see the 24-year-old take over as British number one.
She started the year 150th in the world but is now 66th and will next week pass compatriot Heather Watson in the rankings.
Williams, the current world number 24, has won seven Grand Slams since turning professional in October 1994.
""I went on court to win and to do my best,"" said Konta. ""I gave my all. It just wasn't enough.
""I lost to a pretty incredible champion. She played an incredible match. I just feel very fortunate that I got to share the court with her.""
Konta made Williams work hard for the victory, becoming the first person to take a set off her at the Wuhan Open after losing the first.
She then led 5-3 in the final set and looked on course to record another upset at the tournament.
However Williams drew upon all of her experience to grind out the victory, coming out on top in a breathtaking final game that saw the crowd applaud midway through one particularly impressive rally.

195,"Sarah Champion faced a backlash after writing in the Sun that ""Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls"".
The Rotherham MP quit as shadow equalities minister and apologised for her ""extremely poor choice of words"".
The Labour leader denied claims he had sacked Ms Champion for speaking out.
He told BBC Manchester: ""Child exploitation is wrong. Child abuse is wrong. It is a crime, and it has to be dealt with.
""But you cannot blame an entire community, an entire nation or an entire ethnic community. You have to deal with it for the crime of what it is.""
Asked if he had sacked Ms Champion over her comments, he said: ""Look, she resigned and I accepted the resignation, so, clearly, I think it's right thing to do and I thank her for her work.""
Communities Secretary Sajid Javid accused Mr Corbyn of stifling debate.
The Conservative minister said in a tweet: ""Corbyn wrong to sack Sarah Champion. We need an honest open debate on child sexual exploitation, including racial motivation.""
Business Minister Margot James said she was ""enraged"" by the Labour leader's ""treatment of Sarah Champion"".
She wrote on her Facebook page that the Rotherham MP's comments ""might have been hard hitting, but that doesn't make them any less true"".
The Conservative MP for Stourbridge added: ""There needs to be a discussion about how we overcome the cultural attitudes towards women that have contributed to these crimes; and to the ways in which they were covered up for so long.
""There has been a disgraceful history of shouting down brave Labour women MPs who have stood up to community pressures in Northern cities like Keighley (just google former MP Ann Cryer) and Rotherham in exposing these crimes, of which the appalling treatment of Sarah Champion is yet another chapter.""
Conservative former Children's Minister Tim Loughton said he did not know if Ms Champion had been sacked or not - but he accused Mr Corbyn of being ""deaf to a problem that is happening in our country"".
The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it was a ""real shame"" that Ms Champion had resigned because of ""over-sensitivity about language"".
Labour's shadow justice minister, Yasmin Qureshi, refused to be drawn on whether it was right that Ms Champion had stepped down.
""I think you need to ask Sarah that question,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
""Of course we should deal with abuse wherever it occurs and we should ask ourselves as to what we can do to ensure these things don't happen.""
Ms Champion's article was written after 17 men were convicted of forcing girls in Newcastle to have sex.
The men, who were mostly British-born, were of Iraqi, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iranian and Turkish heritage.
In interviews following the convictions, the Labour MP said such crimes involved ""predominately Pakistani men"" and a fear of being called racist was hampering the authorities' investigations.
She then wrote the Sun article, which also included the line: ""These people are predators, and the common denominator is their ethnic heritage.""
Among the article's critics was fellow Labour MP Naz Shah, who said it was ""irresponsible"" and ""setting a dangerous precedent"".
Following the backlash, Ms Champion sought to distance herself from the article, claiming it had been altered, something denied by the newspaper.
Announcing she was stepping down, Ms Champion said: ""I apologise for the offence caused by the extremely poor choice of words in the Sun article on Friday.

196,"Spanish Trade Secretary Jaime Garcia Legaz said the EU would intervene over Argentina's seizure of the controlling stake in YPF from Spanish firm Repsol.
Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also offered support.
But Argentine officials said they were not worried by possible reprisals over the nationalisation.
Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced the measure on Monday, saying she was asserting sovereignty over Argentina's energy resources.
Her government is taking 51% of YPF, wiping out Repsol's 57.4% majority stake.
The move has wide support in Argentina but has provoked outrage in Spain, which has threatened reprisals.
The Spanish government will consider what measures to take at a cabinet meeting on Friday, and has also been rallying international support.
""There are going to be very clear interventions on the part of the European Union,"" Trade Secretary Jaime Garcia Legaz said, without revealing further details.
It is not clear what any reprisals might involve.
EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday.
Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said Spain would also raise the issue with the IMF, the World Bank and the G-20.
""We will try to pressurise Argentina so that it sees that this road is going nowhere,""  he said after meeting Hillary Clinton.
He added that Spain and the US had agreed to work together to ""re-establish international legality"".
But the Argentine government says it will not back down in its decision to nationalise YPF, which it says is a lawful action taken in the national interest.
""The government takes its decisions thinking about the Argentine people and not what the US or the Spanish government think,"" Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo said.
""We are not worried about any kind of reprisals,"" he added.
Repsol has said it wants around $10bn for its stake in YPF, but Argentina has said it does not accept that valuation.
It says YPF did not invest enough to increase output from its oil fields, forcing Argentina to rely on imports.

Mr Coleman said: ""These cost reductions are critical to progressing our turnaround and delivering a cost base which supports a sustainable core bank.""
He said it would continue to consult colleagues and trade unions on the proposals over the coming weeks.
""We have made progress in turning the bank around since 2013, but have always been clear that the bank's recovery is a difficult journey.""
He said the business would not make a profit this year or next year while it continues its ""turnaround plan in a challenging economic environment"".
Rob MacGregor, national officer at trade union Unite, said: ""The speed and breadth of these cuts will hit the Co-operative Bank's much cherished customer service and with it the bank's unique selling point.

He said the union would be supporting members and pressing the bank to reconsider the cuts where possible.
The bank was owned by the Co-operative Group until 2013, when a Â£1.5bn hole was discovered in its finances.
